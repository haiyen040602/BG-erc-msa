Excuse me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Is there a problem? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well what's the problem?  Let me change it. ####<iemocap>neutral
What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm here to get an ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Like what?  Like a birth certificate? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's out of control. ####<iemocap>angry
How long have you been working here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something? ####<iemocap>neutral
That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you have your forms? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Let me see them. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Who told you to get in this line? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This form is a Z.X.four. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  I need another ID, a separate one. ####<iemocap>frustrated
A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter? ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't... ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices. ####<iemocap>neutral
There's people that have given more though, you know? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
There's babies over there, though, that need mothers. ####<iemocap>neutral
Just, you know, kicking myself. ####<iemocap>sadness
things just aren't what they seem. ####<iemocap>sadness
If not me then, who? ####<iemocap>sadness
You'll videotape everything, yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Last month--  Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
I have to find sitters. ####<iemocap>neutral
We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street. ####<iemocap>sadness
And your mother is close by. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll send you lots of letters. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why it has to be you. ####<iemocap>sadness
What am I going to do? Huh? ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Don't you guys have access to computers over there. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't raise a baby by myself.  How? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's just not fair. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well Vegas was awesome. ####<iemocap>joy
And, um, I got married. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah.  In the old town part. ####<iemocap>joy
Um- Yes.  It was very romantic. ####<iemocap>joy
It was at the slot machines. ####<iemocap>joy
Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day. ####<iemocap>joy
But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  Totally. ####<iemocap>joy
I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now ####<iemocap>excited
He likes to keep tabs, you know. ####<iemocap>joy
Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars. ####<iemocap>neutral
Penny slots. That's what he plays. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like- ####<iemocap>joy
Fifty bucks. Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well so now we're married. We have cat children. ####<iemocap>joy
We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet. ####<iemocap>joy
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
So what's up?  What's new? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  I heard. ####<iemocap>neutral
Shut up.  No- in Vegas? ####<iemocap>neutral
Who did you marry? ####<iemocap>excited
He turned to you and was like... ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time? ####<iemocap>neutral
Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Is that your phone? ####<iemocap>joy
He loves you. ####<iemocap>joy
How much did he win at the slot? ####<iemocap>neutral
Really? Penny slots? ####<iemocap>neutral
Wow. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks. ####<iemocap>neutral
like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] Cat babies. ####<iemocap>joy
That's fair enough. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He just... ####<iemocap>neutral
you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why?  It's a piece of paper. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but... ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's baloney, that's baloney. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Please. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know, you're riding the bus, too. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why?  What choice? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're saving the environment. mmhmm ####<iemocap>frustrated
Interesting.  That's fantastic. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not frustrated. ####<iemocap>angry
Who do you think you are? ####<iemocap>angry
You are so high and mighty.  I just-- ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to. ####<iemocap>angry
The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to. ####<iemocap>angry
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice. ####<iemocap>angry
Have you tried, uh, Craig's List? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  There's regular jobs on there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh huh. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's like a manager for a theatre. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job. ####<iemocap>neutral
You did? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Hmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  Do you have a resume? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's kind of helpful when getting a job. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  But it has an outline, you know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, yeah.  I would imagine. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now. ####<iemocap>neutral
maybe get a car. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe. ####<iemocap>neutral
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>neutral
I am riding the bus, but by choice. ####<iemocap>neutral
To save the environment, carpool. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes.  One less car at a time. ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because... ####<iemocap>frustrated
...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't think I'm anyone. ####<iemocap>neutral
I- I-I didn't-- okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? Oh.  So now you're... ####<iemocap>frustrated
you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hi. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I need my bag. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nash. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Flight seven fourteen. ####<iemocap>angry
Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here? ####<iemocap>angry
Is this a joke? ####<iemocap>angry
Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline. ####<iemocap>angry
You're kidding me, this is a joke. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive. ####<iemocap>angry
We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you understand who my husband is? ####<iemocap>angry
If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here? ####<iemocap>angry
You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble. ####<iemocap>angry
Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue? ####<iemocap>angry
Because I probably know him. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't want money, I want my clothes. ####<iemocap>angry
What's your name? ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  I'll do that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet. ####<iemocap>angry
A letter? I'll make a personal phone call. ####<iemocap>angry
Hi.  Thanks for waiting. ####<iemocap>neutral
Can I help you? ####<iemocap>joy
Uh huh. ####<iemocap>joy
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue? ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um- ####<iemocap>neutral
we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again... ####<iemocap>neutral
for such an inconvenience and your bag, but ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no.  This is real. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because... ####<iemocap>neutral
this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. Calm- ####<iemocap>neutral
Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really ####<iemocap>neutral
We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's a gift. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here. ####<iemocap>neutral
With the amount of-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi. ####<iemocap>neutral
Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess. ####<iemocap>neutral
Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could. ####<iemocap>neutral
If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more... ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
That's sweet. ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago. ####<iemocap>sadness
I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city. ####<iemocap>sadness
So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know. ####<iemocap>sadness
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And- ####<iemocap>sadness
this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
At the cemetery? ####<iemocap>sadness
couple hours. ####<iemocap>sadness
I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors. ####<iemocap>sadness
My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her. ####<iemocap>sadness
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day. ####<iemocap>sadness
Umm. Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm... ####<iemocap>sadness
But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool. ####<iemocap>sadness
Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and- ####<iemocap>sadness
There's another one, I can't remember. ####<iemocap>neutral
I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know? ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm sorry, Joy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...? ####<iemocap>neutral
...pick up anything? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out. ####<iemocap>sadness
Hmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh.  She was there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
How long were you there for? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh really? ####<iemocap>neutral
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery? ####<iemocap>neutral
Is it a big cemetery? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
So she wrote a lot of poetry? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. We should throw a party. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  I'm not sure. ####<iemocap>excited
Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother. ####<iemocap>excited
I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Did you get the letter? ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah. That is so awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood? ####<iemocap>excited
This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party. ####<iemocap>excited
A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay. ####<iemocap>excited
I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  Big time. ####<iemocap>excited
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice ####<iemocap>neutral
That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question. ####<iemocap>excited
You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning. ####<iemocap>excited
Yay...School's fun. ####<iemocap>excited
Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it. ####<iemocap>joy
What's he going to say? ####<iemocap>frustrated
How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's dreaming of him again, walking around. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want to do?  Argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof? ####<iemocap>frustrated
To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I got an idea, but what's your story? ####<iemocap>neutral
From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why does it have to be Annie? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want a diagram. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He thinks he's coming back Chris. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead... ####<iemocap>frustrated
...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just give it some more thought. ####<iemocap>neutral
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
You have a business here.  What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Just don't think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can see that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
He was out here when it broke. ####<iemocap>neutral
Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I guess he is. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've got to say it to him. ####<iemocap>neutral
For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>neutral
So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Then it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I wanted to get this settled first. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him. ####<iemocap>neutral
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>neutral
So what.  I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Mom, what do you want?  A diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York. ####<iemocap>neutral
I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
On this, I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then help me stay here. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know that.  Then just help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He's not going to marry her. ####<iemocap>angry
It's got that about it. ####<iemocap>angry
What is going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited. ####<iemocap>angry
Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right. ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. ####<iemocap>angry
I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>angry
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look. ####<iemocap>angry
Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe. ####<iemocap>angry
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now listen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know why she waited? ####<iemocap>neutral
Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do? What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Kate. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
You're the only one who still loves his parents. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not so bad; it's a good thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay. ####<iemocap>neutral
For one thing, your mother much as told me to go. ####<iemocap>neutral
And then, you.  You've been kind of... ####<iemocap>neutral
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew they would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come? ####<iemocap>neutral
I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
No. No ####<iemocap>joy
Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time. ####<iemocap>neutral
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>neutral
You started to write me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
beating around the bush. ####<iemocap>joy
I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me. ####<iemocap>joy
Not like that you're not. ####<iemocap>joy
Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
How many? ####<iemocap>neutral
Aw, geez. ####<iemocap>sadness
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
What would I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it? ####<iemocap>neutral
You're not sorry you came. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set. ####<iemocap>neutral
I love you. Annie, I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say. ####<iemocap>joy
Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us. ####<iemocap>joy
You felt something that far back? ####<iemocap>neutral
Why didn't you let me know? ####<iemocap>joy
Give me a... ####<iemocap>joy
Give me a kiss. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy. ####<iemocap>joy
I kissed you. ####<iemocap>joy
Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here. ####<iemocap>sadness
No it's nothing like that. It's- ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't even know how to start. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Pretty much all. ####<iemocap>sadness
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know? ####<iemocap>sadness
Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them. ####<iemocap>sadness
But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just want you to know Annie. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's not your flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours. ####<iemocap>angry
How's that supposed to make me feel? ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
I'm cold. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, then let's go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Not particularly. ####<iemocap>neutral
Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh Augie ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Is that, is that-- ####<iemocap>excited
The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Whose is it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh...well. Yeah, of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year? ####<iemocap>neutral
Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket. ####<iemocap>neutral
Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait, that's my point, too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>neutral
Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever. ####<iemocap>neutral
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested. ####<iemocap>neutral
For real? ####<iemocap>neutral
God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life? ####<iemocap>neutral
And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car. ####<iemocap>neutral
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot. ####<iemocap>neutral
We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed. ####<iemocap>excited
God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this. ####<iemocap>joy
Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming. ####<iemocap>excited
It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge. ####<iemocap>excited
So what do you think? ####<iemocap>joy
About all of that, about all I was talking about. ####<iemocap>joy
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive. ####<iemocap>angry
Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever? ####<iemocap>angry
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever. ####<iemocap>angry
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You don't understand anything I am saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is. ####<iemocap>sadness
For God's sake, this is not about fish. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married. ####<iemocap>neutral
You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be. ####<iemocap>joy
dancing barefoot in the sand. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no. Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you understand what I am saying? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know you are Augie, I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  Don't you know that? ####<iemocap>neutral
You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself. ####<iemocap>sadness
So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, you bought refreshments. ####<iemocap>joy
I guess we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so, what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
About what I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
Not just me, look at all of these people. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then, what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They'll show up this time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. Of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sure.  All right.  Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Listen, do you want to dance? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want to take off your shoes? ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to get married again? ####<iemocap>joy
What?  What?  Do you want a divorce? ####<iemocap>neutral
No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you know what you get?  You get this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Maybe if you were with someone else, too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just- I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>neutral
And look what I got here. ####<iemocap>joy
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to go home?  Are you cold? ####<iemocap>neutral
Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come. ####<iemocap>neutral
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Is it them? ####<iemocap>neutral
Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>joy
We'll behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>excited
I think I shall do a curtsy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes.  Meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious. ####<iemocap>joy
Who's they? ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Elliott, worms don't pop. ####<iemocap>joy
Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Good God. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
It must be them then. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
With perfect poise. ####<iemocap>joy
It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they? ####<iemocap>joy
Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean? ####<iemocap>joy
Who knows? ####<iemocap>joy
Yes.  Yes with all of his might. ####<iemocap>excited
Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best. ####<iemocap>joy
It was a terrible thing.  I hated it. ####<iemocap>neutral
That was a rouser, wasn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>joy
And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>joy
Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch. ####<iemocap>joy
I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't be stupid. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>angry
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man. ####<iemocap>angry
No it isn't. ####<iemocap>angry
You shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes I did, quite a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Mind your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You've always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>neutral
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio. ####<iemocap>neutral
They are away in Tunis. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  Yes I am. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad. ####<iemocap>angry
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. ####<iemocap>neutral
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What about me? ####<iemocap>angry
So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll have a little, I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Really, Amanda. ####<iemocap>angry
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you going out somewhere, dear? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder. ####<iemocap>angry
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? ####<iemocap>angry
And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow. ####<iemocap>angry
I think I am not in the least bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry

Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Oh yeah, that would be.  Well, depends on what type of car you had, though too. I guess it would be worth it. helicopter. Yeah, helicopter.  There is a helipad there, right? Yeah, exactly. ####<iemocap>joy
They do it's--believe me it's huge. ####<iemocap>joy
I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and... ####<iemocap>excited
It's pretty wild. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, well I doubt [GARBAGE] ping pong [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh you mean it's not really sport that what you're saying? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's totally a sport. What are you talking about? ####<iemocap>neutral
For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time? ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah we have like away games and stuff. ####<iemocap>neutral
But you know I'm like [GARBAGE]. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to have a mustache...On the force... ####<iemocap>joy
Pull over.. ####<iemocap>joy
What he's going to say? ####<iemocap>frustrated
When? ####<iemocap>neutral
How could he see it?  I was the first one up and he was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
What was he doing here at four in the morning? ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
Cried hard? ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>sadness
What is he doing out here at that hour? ####<iemocap>frustrated
He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean a mistake? ####<iemocap>angry
What do you want to do, argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it? ####<iemocap>angry
To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you? ####<iemocap>angry
The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so-- ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, that's only your business, Chris. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm just saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you ask Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>angry
That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. ####<iemocap>angry
He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>angry
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, must you be inspired. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, I can see that. ####<iemocap>angry
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  I figured I'd just let it wait. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess he is. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I got to. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh? ####<iemocap>angry
She is not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life... ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first. ####<iemocap>sadness
So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that. ####<iemocap>angry
If that can't happen here... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, on this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then help me stay here mom. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then help me stay. ####<iemocap>sadness
I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>angry
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why did he invite her here? ####<iemocap>angry
It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden? ####<iemocap>angry
What is going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look. ####<iemocap>angry
Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, maybe he wanted see her. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her? ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh so what? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, now listen, kids... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Listen. Line. You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And how do you know why she's waited. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do?  What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Kate... ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, calm yourself. Alright. ####<iemocap>frustrated
calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you. You're shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What the hell do you want from me, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
The only one I know still love his parents. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here. ####<iemocap>sadness
For one thing your mother as much as told me to go. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of... ####<iemocap>sadness
You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here. ####<iemocap>sadness
From her point of view why else would I come? ####<iemocap>neutral
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>neutral
Everyday since. ####<iemocap>excited
Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know. ####<iemocap>excited
I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you. ####<iemocap>joy
Chris, what's the matter? ####<iemocap>sadness
No, what is it?  Is your mother? ####<iemocap>sadness
You got to tell me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Wouldn't work like this. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>sadness
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING]. Geez. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
What would I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
You're not sorry you came? ####<iemocap>joy
Why not? ####<iemocap>sadness
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
You did? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Ann, I love you.  I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
Why didn't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
why didn't you let me know? ####<iemocap>excited
I kissed you.  I kissed Annie. ####<iemocap>excited
I kissed you. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, no, it's nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things. ####<iemocap>sadness
you know over seas I was in command of the company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Pretty much all. ####<iemocap>sadness
Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. ####<iemocap>sadness
He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today... ####<iemocap>sadness
And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument... ####<iemocap>sadness
You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all... ####<iemocap>sadness
You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again... ####<iemocap>sadness
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator. ####<iemocap>sadness
'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man... ####<iemocap>sadness
And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I want you to know Annie. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm going to make a fortune for you. ####<iemocap>joy
Ugh... ####<iemocap>frustrated
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
You keep saying "my flashlight" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel? ####<iemocap>angry
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder if they can hear me talk ####<iemocap>joy
I'm cold. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's after eleven, let's go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is no point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's my point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then let's go. ####<iemocap>angry
Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes. ####<iemocap>angry
Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions. ####<iemocap>angry
We didn't see them the year before either. ####<iemocap>angry
What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it. ####<iemocap>excited
Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good. ####<iemocap>excited
Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it-- ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right? ####<iemocap>excited
Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot? ####<iemocap>excited
Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, well, yeah of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid. ####<iemocap>excited
I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even. ####<iemocap>excited
