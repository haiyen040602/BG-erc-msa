I can't help it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again? ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know he's even thinking of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, so what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now, listen Kate. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know why she's waited? ####<iemocap>neutral
Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, what do you want me to do about it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But Kate-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  All right.  Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What does that mean?  Me above all? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you.  Look at you shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
from her point of view, why else would I come? ####<iemocap>sadness
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>joy
You started to write me and-- ####<iemocap>joy
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you. ####<iemocap>joy
Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed. ####<iemocap>sadness
You've gotta tell me. ####<iemocap>sadness
It wouldn't work this way. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>sadness
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, gee. ####<iemocap>sadness
You still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
What'll I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
You're not sorry you came? ####<iemocap>neutral
You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  Nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know how to start. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's after eleven, let's just go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ah, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight. ####<iemocap>excited
This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better. ####<iemocap>excited
I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it. ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think? ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, well sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember? ####<iemocap>neutral
You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket. ####<iemocap>neutral
This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now. ####<iemocap>excited
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped. ####<iemocap>excited
You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's my point too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean, ####<iemocap>excited
this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life. ####<iemocap>neutral
We weren't in a good spot. ####<iemocap>neutral
There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this. ####<iemocap>excited
all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters. ####<iemocap>excited
It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name. ####<iemocap>excited
They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death. ####<iemocap>excited
Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so what do you think? ####<iemocap>neutral
What I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married. ####<iemocap>sadness
I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork. ####<iemocap>sadness
And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that, Augie.  Really, I do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
Augie, you brought refreshments. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, then we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, so what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
What I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people. ####<iemocap>neutral
Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home. ####<iemocap>neutral
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice.  That's not ever. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, we'll see them this year. ####<iemocap>neutral
I thought you wanted to see it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky." ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait a minute.  I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance? ####<iemocap>neutral
You want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You wanna get married again? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What?  What?  You want a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish? ####<iemocap>angry
No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us ####<iemocap>sadness
'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know, me neither. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, look what we have here. ####<iemocap>joy
It's not champagne. ####<iemocap>joy
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you think it's them? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
What're we gonna do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Ah, it send shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy. ####<iemocap>joy
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. ####<iemocap>joy
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
Who's they? ####<iemocap>neutral
If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, dear, shall we like that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh? ####<iemocap>neutral
Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. ####<iemocap>joy
Elliott, worms don't pop. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you. ####<iemocap>joy
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>joy
Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. ####<iemocap>joy
It went in intermittently for days. ####<iemocap>joy
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. ####<iemocap>joy
That was the first time you ever hit me. ####<iemocap>neutral
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. ####<iemocap>joy
It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous. ####<iemocap>excited
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number. ####<iemocap>neutral
With the most perfect poise? ####<iemocap>neutral
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, darling, don't say that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love? ####<iemocap>neutral
You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want. ####<iemocap>neutral
All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths. ####<iemocap>neutral
