also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system. ####<meld>neutral
You mustve had your hands full. ####<meld>neutral
That I did. That I did. ####<meld>neutral
So lets talk a little bit about your duties. ####<meld>neutral
My duties?  All right. ####<meld>surprise
Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties. ####<meld>neutral
I see. ####<meld>neutral
But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them. ####<meld>neutral
Good to know. ####<meld>neutral
We can go into detail ####<meld>neutral
No dont I beg of you! ####<meld>fear
All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Absolutely.  You can relax ####<meld>neutral
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? ####<meld>surprise
You know? Forget it! ####<meld>sadness

Um-mm, yeah right! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! ####<meld>surprise

He was with her when he wrote this poem. ####<meld>neutral
Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. ####<meld>neutral
Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' ####<meld>neutral
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. ####<meld>sadness
Done. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise

Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Howd did it go? ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up. ####<meld>joy
Im so proud of you. ####<meld>joy
Me too! ####<meld>joy

Oh-ho-ho, yeah! ####<meld>joy
Which part exactly? ####<meld>neutral
The whole thing! Can we go? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics. ####<meld>anger
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part! ####<meld>joy
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part? ####<meld>neutral
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic. ####<meld>surprise
You fell asleep!! ####<meld>anger
There was no kangaroo! ####<meld>anger
They didnt take any of my suggestions! ####<meld>anger
Thats for coming buddy. ####<meld>neutral
Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Dont go! ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Im so sorry! ####<meld>sadness
Look! ####<meld>surprise
This guy fell asleep! ####<meld>anger
He fell asleep too! ####<meld>anger
Be mad at him! ####<meld>anger
Or, call an ambulance. ####<meld>anger
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. ####<meld>neutral
What?! What is with everybody? Its Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day! ####<meld>anger
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. ####<meld>neutral
See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity ####<meld>neutral
Okay, thats enough honey! ####<meld>neutral
I dont know.  Let me see the ring. ####<meld>neutral
Great! Okay, here. ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And ####<meld>joy
What've you been up to? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. ####<meld>neutral

Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her. ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
I'm back. ####<meld>neutral
So, are we gonna get together or what? ####<meld>neutral
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish? ####<meld>neutral
Great, I'll see you then. ####<meld>neutral
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. ####<meld>joy
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob." ####<meld>neutral
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god. You are pure evil. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this ####<meld>anger
Nobody! ####<meld>anger
Nobody respects the bucket! ####<meld>anger
You wouldn't believe what people put in here! ####<meld>anger
Look! ####<meld>anger
Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you? ####<meld>anger
No. ####<meld>neutral
This is my wedding. ####<meld>neutral

Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time. ####<meld>joy
Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now? ####<meld>disgust
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Whats wrong with you? ####<meld>disgust
Nothing! ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. ####<meld>fear
But um, I dont think its anything serious. ####<meld>neutral
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor! ####<meld>surprise
No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! ####<meld>fear
Thats a hernia. ####<meld>disgust
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s! ####<meld>anger
I love your place! Where is this guy from? ####<meld>joy
Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs. ####<meld>surprise
So much more. ####<meld>neutral
Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young. ####<meld>neutral
Okay ####<meld>neutral
But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Really. ####<meld>neutral
You dont think this is too fast. ####<meld>neutral
Get Out! ####<meld>anger
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, please!  So, what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God, wh-what happened? ####<meld>surprise
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! ####<meld>sadness
I knew that was him! ####<meld>anger
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, you ok? ####<meld>neutral
I guess. ####<meld>sadness
There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. ####<meld>neutral
I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else. ####<meld>neutral
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later? ####<meld>neutral
Or we could throw you both in ####<meld>joy
Ok, gentlemen! ####<meld>anger
Please! ####<meld>anger
Aren't we a little old for this? ####<meld>anger
I mean, we're scientists, right? ####<meld>neutral
We're academics. ####<meld>anger
And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. ####<meld>joy
GO, GO, GO! ####<meld>joy
Go, go, go! ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat! ####<meld>joy
Oy!! ####<meld>disgust
Whats with all this sand? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later. ####<meld>anger
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up. ####<meld>joy
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference? ####<meld>neutral
Rach? What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary! ####<meld>fear
It's a diaper commercial. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!! ####<meld>fear
Pizza delivery! ####<meld>joy
I'll get it! I will get that! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, the ball thing. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! ####<meld>joy
Uhh, ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear

No! ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>joy
You guys were totally right! ####<meld>joy
This is so much better than the first time we went out. ####<meld>joy
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
That was so awkward, we were really nervous. ####<meld>neutral
Didnt you sleep together? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that really calms me down. ####<meld>neutral
And! ####<meld>joy
We have so much in common! ####<meld>joy
She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do. ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
How does she do that? ####<meld>surprise
I cannot sleep in a public place. ####<meld>neutral
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. ####<meld>joy
Oh! What what what! ...Hi. ####<meld>surprise
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. ####<meld>neutral
What's going on with you? ####<meld>surprise
I got no sleep last night! ####<meld>anger
Why? ####<meld>neutral
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, and deaf. ####<meld>neutral
So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. ####<meld>neutral
You have no idea how loud they are! ####<meld>disgust
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Ew! What is that? Something exploded! ####<meld>disgust
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you? ####<meld>neutral
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking? ####<meld>surprise
Breathe, breathe, breathe. ####<meld>neutral
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead. ####<meld>surprise
Okay! You dont think I thought of that? ####<meld>anger
How can you not know which one? ####<meld>surprise
I mean thats unbelievable. ####<meld>joy
I mean, was it Gina? ####<meld>neutral
Which one is Gina? ####<meld>neutral
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, no, thats Dina. ####<meld>neutral
You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny. ####<meld>neutral
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. ####<meld>neutral
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. ####<meld>neutral
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you. ####<meld>joy
Really!? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. ####<meld>neutral
I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What? ####<meld>joy
What should I wear, now Im all nervous. ####<meld>fear

I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful. ####<meld>joy
: Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball. ####<meld>joy
Oh well, okay, good luck. ####<meld>joy

: Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me. ####<meld>neutral
No, Im good. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this? ####<meld>surprise
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so ####<meld>neutral
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition? ####<meld>surprise
Who knows? ####<meld>neutral
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much. ####<meld>neutral
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later! ####<meld>joy
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Actually, that can't happen. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. ####<meld>neutral
So it'll be either you two  or you two. ####<meld>neutral
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, it is. ####<meld>neutral
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new. ####<meld>joy
Please! ####<meld>anger
Are you kidding? ####<meld>anger
I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am. ####<meld>anger
And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you. ####<meld>joy
I think youve got concussion. ####<meld>fear
No, no, Im serious. Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you? ####<meld>fear
Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not. ####<meld>sadness
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David. ####<meld>surprise
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do". ####<meld>joy
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. ####<meld>neutral
David is going to propose to Phoebe. ####<meld>joy
What?  Why? ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, we have talked about this. ####<meld>anger
You are not supposed to give people advice! ####<meld>anger
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke? ####<meld>anger
I ####<meld>neutral
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! ####<meld>anger
She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone ####<meld>anger
Man, that's some ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's not what you want... ####<meld>neutral
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller. ####<meld>neutral
It-its great to meet you Paul. ####<meld>joy
I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens. ####<meld>neutral
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens. ####<meld>neutral
So Ross, what your problem? ####<meld>anger
Eh-whExcuse me? ####<meld>surprise
Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age? ####<meld>anger
Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny. ####<meld>fear
I ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I can, I can see that. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind. ####<meld>fear
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute. ####<meld>anger
Daddy! ####<meld>surprise
Oh well, its not on TV yet. ####<meld>neutral
Well, then its not on the wall yet. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? ####<meld>neutral
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that havent been cleaned yet? ####<meld>neutral
Ooooohh! ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Was it...? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there. ####<meld>neutral
"Ooo," what? ####<meld>surprise
Uma Thurman. ####<meld>neutral

Guys? ####<meld>anger
Guys? ####<meld>anger
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her. ####<meld>neutral
Feminist issue. That's where I went! ####<meld>neutral
She is gonna hate me. ####<meld>fear

Yep! That's hilarious! ####<meld>joy
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too. ####<meld>neutral
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily. ####<meld>neutral
What?! You totally get embarrassed! ####<meld>surprise
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are. ####<meld>neutral
Is that so? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am ####<meld>disgust
I cant believe it! ####<meld>surprise

I rode a bike! ####<meld>joy
I never thought Id be able to do that! ####<meld>joy
Thank you Ross. ####<meld>joy
Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them. ####<meld>joy
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you two are-are my I mean, Im lucky to have just one good ####<meld>neutral

Call it even?! ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Well, Im gonna go get these  in some water. ####<meld>neutral
Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding? ####<meld>surprise

Huh? ####<meld>surprise
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! ####<meld>anger
I talk to you and nothin. ####<meld>anger
You look at me, and its nothin. ####<meld>anger
Nothing. ####<meld>anger
Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice. ####<meld>joy
I have a question about this scene. ####<meld>neutral
Yes? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor. ####<meld>disgust
Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey, how about this one. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, its says so in the script! ####<meld>anger
Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch. ####<meld>anger
It doesnt say that in the script. ####<meld>anger
It does in mine! ####<meld>anger
I cant ####<meld>anger
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. ####<meld>anger
Yknow who has a great video camera? ####<meld>neutral
Greg and Jenny? ####<meld>neutral
Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em. ####<meld>neutral
Lets call em. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs! ####<meld>joy
Hello?  Eighth street deli? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place. ####<meld>disgust
Uh sorry, wrong number. ####<meld>fear
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Hello?   Its the deli again! ####<meld>surprise
All right! Ill have a sandwich! ####<meld>joy
I dont think this numbers right! ####<meld>sadness
Oh come on!! ####<meld>sadness
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now ####<meld>sadness
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma? ####<meld>surprise
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. ####<meld>neutral
Sure. So how long you been... ####<meld>neutral
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships? ####<meld>neutral
Since then?! ####<meld>surprise
No, it's only been six years. ####<meld>neutral
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ####<meld>neutral
...Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Y'ever been in love? ####<meld>neutral
...I d'know. ####<meld>neutral
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes. ####<meld>neutral
You're one to talk. ####<meld>disgust
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. ####<meld>neutral
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma. ####<meld>disgust
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you. ####<meld>surprise
Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick? ####<meld>neutral
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Rach, how was work? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair. ####<meld>neutral
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. ####<meld>neutral
Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and... ####<meld>neutral
Something wrong? ####<meld>neutral
No. Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that's it? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Dude, I am sorry about what I said! ####<meld>sadness
No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name! ####<meld>disgust
Its not that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name. ####<meld>anger
So, youre just Bing? ####<meld>neutral
Because we won our apartment back! ####<meld>joy
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace! ####<meld>surprise
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four! ####<meld>anger
I dont know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha! ####<meld>surprise
All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high! ####<meld>anger
Uh-huh, not as high as It worked! King! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah baby! ####<meld>joy
But, we pick again! We pick again! ####<meld>joy
Why?! ####<meld>neutral
I dont know! ####<meld>fear
Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby! ####<meld>joy
Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back! ####<meld>surprise
No they didnt! ####<meld>joy
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil? ####<meld>neutral
It's gonna be worth it. ####<meld>neutral
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right? ####<meld>neutral
Women love guys who love babies. ####<meld>neutral
It's that whole sensitive thing. ####<meld>neutral
Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe one of them will break away. ####<meld>neutral
No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. ####<meld>joy
All right, gimme the baby. ####<meld>neutral
No, I got him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, seriously you want him? ####<meld>surprise
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me? ####<meld>surprise
You wanna smell him? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head. ####<meld>joy
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? ####<meld>joy
Well, we are great guys. ####<meld>neutral
Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Well, not really. ####<meld>neutral
I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. ####<meld>neutral
Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou. ####<meld>anger
Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. What-what should I do? ####<meld>fear
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. ####<meld>neutral
I mean whats more important? ####<meld>neutral
What people think or how you feel, huh? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, you gotta follow your heart. ####<meld>neutral
Joey that is so sweet. ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday? ####<meld>neutral
I couldnt do it. ####<meld>sadness
You couldnt do it?! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Youre going out with her again! ####<meld>surprise
Going out with who? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Dana Keystone from college. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh ####<meld>surprise
No, that was Dana Caplin. ####<meld>neutral
Joey! You didnt even know her! ####<meld>surprise
Ah whatever! ####<meld>anger
Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! ####<meld>joy
Dont touch him! ####<meld>anger
Okay! ####<meld>surprise
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. ####<meld>neutral
I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. ####<meld>fear
Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! ####<meld>fear
Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! ####<meld>sadness
I mean, I love-I love this little guy! ####<meld>joy
Ah-ah!! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right? ####<meld>surprise
Here you go! ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Stupid! ####<meld>anger
I cant believe it! ####<meld>surprise
God! ####<meld>anger
Hey, how you doin? ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier... ####<meld>sadness
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed. ####<meld>neutral
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. ####<meld>disgust
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office? ####<meld>anger
You had no ####<meld>anger
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I. ####<meld>anger
But I told you, I didnt have the time! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel. ####<meld>anger
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? ####<meld>anger
You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? ####<meld>anger
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, I have to tell you something. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
But I cant tell you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Does it have to do with Joey? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed? ####<meld>neutral
No, but lets come back to that later! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Richard! ####<meld>joy
Actually, Im not here to complement the chef. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. ####<meld>neutral
Like I have nothing better to do! ####<meld>neutral
So whats up? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it was great seeing you the other night. ####<meld>joy
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that? ####<meld>neutral
No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you. ####<meld>joy
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay. ####<meld>disgust
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen? ####<meld>sadness
Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant! ####<meld>anger
Joey, I am scared to death about this. ####<meld>fear
But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help. ####<meld>fear
And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time. ####<meld>neutral
You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap. ####<meld>joy
Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me? ####<meld>anger
Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister! ####<meld>sadness
And youre my big brother! ####<meld>joy
I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world. ####<meld>neutral
Im not even scared to tell mom and dad. ####<meld>neutral
I was scared of telling you. ####<meld>fear
Well Id be scared of them, but all right. ####<meld>fear
Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. ####<meld>sadness
I want him to have his uncle. ####<meld>sadness
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey? ####<meld>sadness
Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey! ####<meld>joy
Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us. ####<meld>joy
Thats right! By his uncle too! ####<meld>joy
And by you. ####<meld>joy
Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment. ####<meld>neutral
Come here! ####<meld>joy
No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?! ####<meld>anger
I had a really nice time tonight. ####<meld>joy
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out. ####<meld>joy
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch. ####<meld>neutral
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw ####<meld>surprise
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up! ####<meld>surprise
Like it would help. ####<meld>neutral
You are so bad! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you. ####<meld>joy
Uh, it was very nice meeting you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre. ####<meld>surprise
Hi Mom, it's Jill. ####<meld>neutral
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule. ####<meld>neutral
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule. ####<meld>neutral
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was ####<meld>joy
Are you seeing anybody right now? ####<meld>neutral
Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out. ####<meld>fear
Im not-Im not-Im not gay! ####<meld>fear
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy? ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
That sounds great! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended. ####<meld>anger
Theres gravy? ####<meld>surprise
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. ####<meld>neutral
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
I think I left a donut up here. ####<meld>neutral
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so Im happy. ####<meld>neutral
Great job team! ####<meld>joy
Tomorrow at 8:30. ####<meld>neutral
Phil! ####<meld>joy
Nice job. ####<meld>joy
Stevens! ####<meld>joy
Way to go! ####<meld>joy
Joel-burg, you maniac! ####<meld>joy
I love ya! ####<meld>joy
Bing! ####<meld>joy
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident. ####<meld>neutral
Of course, you did. ####<meld>joy
Forgot something else too ya bastard! ####<meld>joy
Well, what about you? ####<meld>neutral
Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya? ####<meld>neutral
No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous. ####<meld>sadness
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you? ####<meld>joy
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do! ####<meld>sadness
Now get on out of here, you! ####<meld>joy
Hey Bob. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today? ####<meld>joy
If I see him, Ill ask. ####<meld>neutral
Toby! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Oh then you know each other. ####<meld>neutral
Were on a semi-first name basis. ####<meld>neutral
What do you think of adding him to our team? ####<meld>neutral
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes. ####<meld>surprise
Really? They love him down on six. ####<meld>surprise
But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! ####<meld>joy
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? ####<meld>neutral
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in. ####<meld>joy
You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux! ####<meld>anger
So? ####<meld>neutral
SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!" ####<meld>anger
Well then we still have a problem. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
With what? ####<meld>neutral
Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies. ####<meld>neutral
Oo! You should have one of us do it! ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, were getting ####<meld>neutral
No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff! ####<meld>joy
I call it!! ####<meld>joy
What?! No! It was my idea! ####<meld>anger
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us. ####<meld>neutral
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?! ####<meld>anger
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva! ####<meld>neutral
See, I see.... big passion in your future. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
I do. ####<meld>neutral
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up] ####<meld>joy
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. ####<meld>neutral
Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side. ####<meld>neutral
What?!?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill. ####<meld>neutral
You can spill. In the sink. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening. ####<meld>sadness
I love you, too. ####<meld>joy
Aww, good.  What? ####<meld>joy
What? Im just said. ####<meld>sadness
No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
I would love to live with you Ross.. thats-thats great! Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out. ####<meld>neutral
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! ####<meld>joy
I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. ####<meld>sadness
You just saved me! ####<meld>joy
Youre my hero! ####<meld>joy
Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! ####<meld>joy
Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya? ####<meld>joy
No. ####<meld>neutral
No, I wont. ####<meld>neutral
But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. ####<meld>neutral
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! ####<meld>anger
...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready? ####<meld>anger
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. ####<meld>joy
Lose the robe. ####<meld>neutral
Me? ####<meld>surprise
That's great. ####<meld>joy
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, I'm still working on mine. ####<meld>neutral
That's it? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, it was really hard. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, you weren't there. ####<meld>anger
Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice! ####<meld>joy
Pretty nice? ####<meld>neutral
Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this. ####<meld>neutral
We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe. ####<meld>neutral
You gotta take the canoe! ####<meld>anger
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away! ####<meld>neutral
Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe! ####<meld>anger
Good for you!! ####<meld>anger
Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen. ####<meld>neutral
One ticket to Yemen? ####<meld>surprise
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry sir, I dont understand. ####<meld>surprise
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with? ####<meld>neutral
Are you travelling with a child? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but this is the last time. ####<meld>neutral
With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. ####<meld>joy
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen. ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hows she doing? ####<meld>neutral
She? ####<meld>surprise
Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly. ####<meld>neutral
Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive. ####<meld>neutral
Well sensitive is important, pick him. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh sure, go with the sissy. ####<meld>disgust
Jason is not a sissy! ####<meld>anger
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler. ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way. ####<meld>neutral
I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve. ####<meld>neutral
It was an amazing night. ####<meld>joy
It was. It was an amazing night. ####<meld>joy
You think it looked amazing? ####<meld>sadness
Do we have a name yet? ####<meld>neutral
No, not yet. ####<meld>neutral
Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green. ####<meld>neutral
Hello baby girl. ####<meld>joy
Ah-ha, nowhere to run! ####<meld>joy
I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over ####<meld>anger
No Rachel! They got here first! ####<meld>anger
Why is Ross doing that? ####<meld>neutral
DANGER ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women! ####<meld>surprise
No thats all right. Dont worry about it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain! ####<meld>disgust
Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys! ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Look! ####<meld>neutral
Ive never lived like this before. ####<meld>disgust
I know. ####<meld>neutral
All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes! ####<meld>joy
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so ####<meld>surprise
Also so ####<meld>neutral
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"! ####<meld>neutral
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff! ####<meld>neutral
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you. ####<meld>neutral
About what? ####<meld>neutral
He's planning your birthday party. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! I love him! ####<meld>joy
You'd better act surprised. ####<meld>fear
About what? ####<meld>neutral
My surprise party! ####<meld>joy
What surprise party? ####<meld>surprise
Oh stop it. Joey already told me. ####<meld>joy
Well, he didn't tell me. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing. ####<meld>neutral
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything. ####<meld>anger
No, you are not. We tell you stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Yuh-huh! ####<meld>anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. ####<meld>anger
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. ####<meld>anger
Looks like I was second to last. ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! Hes your father.  he should be at the wedding. ####<meld>anger
I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years. ####<meld>disgust
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?! ####<meld>sadness
Its not like we run in the same circles. ####<meld>neutral
I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas. ####<meld>disgust
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles. ####<meld>neutral
Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress. ####<meld>disgust
So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. ####<meld>neutral
Hello! Whos in there? ####<meld>neutral
How ya doin? ####<meld>neutral
Who in the hell are you? ####<meld>anger
I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh? ####<meld>neutral
No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us! ####<meld>fear
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride! ####<meld>anger
Im not gonna marry Chandler! ####<meld>anger
Not after this! ####<meld>anger
Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo. ####<meld>neutral
I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry I'm late, but I left late. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
So Pheebs, what is the book about? ####<meld>neutral
I thought you said you read it in high school. ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about? ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here? ####<meld>neutral
I thought you didn't smoke. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? ####<meld>neutral
And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" ####<meld>surprise
But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time. ####<meld>neutral
We get high. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, me too. ####<meld>neutral
I'm kidding. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, me too. ####<meld>joy
Oh, are you sure you're ok? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Does it still hurt? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>sadness
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this. ####<meld>joy
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, how'd it go? ####<meld>neutral
Excellent. ####<meld>joy
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves. ####<meld>joy
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way. ####<meld>joy
You know what? You are right. I ####<meld>neutral
Good for you Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean ####<meld>neutral
This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired! ####<meld>anger
Its 6:00. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well. ####<meld>neutral
Handling it? ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean, handling it? ####<meld>joy
Theres nothing to handle. ####<meld>joy
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway! ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
Come on! ####<meld>anger
They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous! ####<meld>disgust
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off. ####<meld>neutral
Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres. ####<meld>joy
What the hell is this?! ####<meld>surprise
What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?! ####<meld>anger
This sucks! ####<meld>anger
All right, whats my next present? ####<meld>neutral
All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? ####<meld>neutral
Enhh ####<meld>neutral
Ive got canned goods. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole! ####<meld>surprise
Excellent hole, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no! No!! My hole!! ####<meld>surprise
Ow!! Ow!!! ####<meld>disgust
What?! What?!! What is it?! ####<meld>surprise
My drinking? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I mustve said that after you left. ####<meld>neutral
Said what? Exactly. ####<meld>fear
That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person! ####<meld>disgust
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! ####<meld>fear
If youre gonna get all sensitive about it! ####<meld>anger
I dont want to lose you. ####<meld>sadness
What if I, create a position for you? ####<meld>neutral
Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department. ####<meld>neutral
Say more things like that. ####<meld>joy
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow. ####<meld>joy
Id need an expense account. ####<meld>neutral
Done! ####<meld>joy
And an assistant. ####<meld>neutral
Sophie, get in here! ####<meld>joy
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses. ####<meld>joy
Oh my! ####<meld>surprise
They're male nurses. ####<meld>neutral
Not in my head. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say? ####<meld>joy
Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
What are you talking about?! ####<meld>surprise
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. ####<meld>anger
I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. ####<meld>neutral
Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, why don't you give ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some ####<meld>neutral
Yep! There's always room for ####<meld>neutral

Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Lets bring it in. ####<meld>neutral
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me. ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
That almost hit me in the face. ####<meld>anger
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding. ####<meld>joy
Oh boy, me too! ####<meld>joy
Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>fear
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?! ####<meld>neutral
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature! ####<meld>anger
Thats me! Come on! ####<meld>joy
Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch. ####<meld>neutral
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill. ####<meld>neutral
Shrill?! The wedding is back on! ####<meld>anger
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Nice to meet you! ####<meld>joy
Nice to meet you too. ####<meld>neutral
So, are you ready to go? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! ####<meld>anger
Ill be right with you. ####<meld>neutral
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
You can take it off. ####<meld>neutral
Just slice that baby right off! ####<meld>fear
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
Well that's not a third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
No? ####<meld>surprise
First of all, it's on your ass. ####<meld>neutral
Well then, what is it?! ####<meld>surprise
Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment? ####<meld>neutral
I'm with Hamilton! ####<meld>neutral
He's good with rear things, bring him in too. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, this is great wine. ####<meld>joy
Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona. ####<meld>joy
I studied for a year in Barcelona. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking ####<meld>neutral
I love hiking! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo ####<meld>joy
So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married. ####<meld>surprise
Oh we-we didnt. ####<meld>joy
No-no. We ####<meld>fear
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all. ####<meld>neutral
Why?!! ####<meld>surprise
Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well then shut me up. ####<meld>neutral
Just tell me how. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. ####<meld>fear
Let it go, Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. ####<meld>neutral
Do you all promise? ####<meld>neutral
Chandler? Do you promise to be good? ####<meld>neutral
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Dear Ms. Buffay. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you for calling attention to our error. ####<meld>neutral
We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. ####<meld>neutral

Honey, both yours. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing! ####<meld>joy
Yeah? The work problem? ####<meld>neutral
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again. ####<meld>joy
What problem did you tell him you had? ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties? ####<meld>neutral
No thanks, Mom! ####<meld>disgust
Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha! ####<meld>anger
Very good,  so good. ####<meld>joy
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic. ####<meld>joy
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call. ####<meld>sadness
I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club. ####<meld>sadness
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont! ####<meld>sadness
Come on! Look where you are!! ####<meld>joy
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris. ####<meld>neutral
Remember, a virgin for me please. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you think it will help. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
That was a test! ####<meld>fear
In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! ####<meld>fear
And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice ####<meld>fear
You should! How is she? ####<meld>surprise
Ohhh!! ####<meld>anger
I think somebody needs another lap dance. ####<meld>joy
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg. ####<meld>neutral
You do? ####<meld>surprise
You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman. ####<meld>surprise
That and arrogance. ####<meld>anger
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! How was sailing? ####<meld>joy
Wow thanks! ####<meld>joy
Joe? ####<meld>fear
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Uh, youve had a lot of sex right? ####<meld>neutral
When? Today? Some, not a lot. ####<meld>surprise
Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt. ####<meld>fear
There huhhmm, there-there was an incident. ####<meld>fear
Dont worry about that man, that happens. ####<meld>neutral
Its happened to you? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Once. ####<meld>neutral
Well, whatd you do? ####<meld>surprise
I did it anyway. ####<meld>neutral
Sup? Sup dude? ####<meld>neutral
Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me. ####<meld>fear
So youre playing a little ####<meld>neutral
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19. ####<meld>disgust
Come on man, really how old?! ####<meld>surprise
Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear! ####<meld>disgust
And they knew about it? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about? ####<meld>surprise
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is! ####<meld>anger
The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer. ####<meld>disgust
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right? ####<meld>neutral
Do you always have to bring him here? ####<meld>anger
I didn't wanna leave him alone. ####<meld>neutral
Alright? ####<meld>neutral
We- we had our first fight this morning. ####<meld>neutral
I think it has to do with my working late. ####<meld>neutral
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that'd be great! ####<meld>joy
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie. ####<meld>neutral
Check this out. ####<meld>neutral
It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! ####<meld>surprise
"Its almost as good as being there." ####<meld>neutral
Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear! ####<meld>joy
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood! ####<meld>joy
Uh, may I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed. ####<meld>neutral
Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller. ####<meld>neutral
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king. ####<meld>neutral
Nobody sees the king! ####<meld>anger
Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! You cant go back there! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a ####<meld>sadness
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. ####<meld>neutral
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India. ####<meld>neutral
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea. ####<meld>joy
Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise. ####<meld>neutral
No, I just I think that its too soon. ####<meld>joy
No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven. ####<meld>neutral
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. ####<meld>neutral
And now you want that money back. ####<meld>surprise
Exactly. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? ####<meld>joy
Its not a real game! I made it up! ####<meld>anger
Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. ####<meld>joy
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
But I can see through your sheet. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, that's her. ####<meld>neutral
But y'know what? ####<meld>neutral
Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway. ####<meld>sadness
Why? ####<meld>neutral
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something. ####<meld>sadness
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left! ####<meld>surprise
No. No. No. She lives on the ####<meld>neutral
No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. ####<meld>neutral
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. ####<meld>neutral
You've been counting wrong. ####<meld>neutral
I did ####<meld>anger
Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this. ####<meld>fear
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. ####<meld>joy
Why? Do you have the answers written on there? ####<meld>surprise
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me. ####<meld>neutral
All right, lets do it. ####<meld>fear
All right, gentlemen, youre up first. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie? ####<meld>neutral
Big fat goalie. ####<meld>neutral
Correct. Rachel claims ####<meld>neutral
Dangerous Liaisons ####<meld>neutral
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is... ####<meld>neutral
Weekend at Bernies ####<meld>neutral
Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, come on, we can be guys! ####<meld>joy
No you cant. ####<meld>joy
You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long. ####<meld>disgust
Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!! ####<meld>anger
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. ####<meld>surprise
You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game. ####<meld>fear
Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men. ####<meld>neutral
Pete, can I get you something else? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out. ####<meld>neutral
Havent you and I covered that topic? ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food. ####<meld>joy
Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth. ####<meld>joy
And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. ####<meld>disgust
Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? ####<meld>neutral
I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean. ####<meld>disgust
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. ####<meld>disgust
I mean really, think about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ho-ho, I will. ####<meld>neutral
I believe I read that somewhere! ####<meld>surprise
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ####<meld>anger
Okay? ####<meld>anger
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... ####<meld>anger
It's not funny! ####<meld>anger
I respectfully disagree. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page! ####<meld>anger
Who cares? Nobody reads those things ####<meld>neutral
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today. ####<meld>anger
I don't have a page. ####<meld>neutral
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!! ####<meld>anger
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. ####<meld>joy
Okay, what is in here? Rocks? ####<meld>surprise
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. ####<meld>neutral
So, rocks. ####<meld>disgust
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. ####<meld>sadness
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little? ####<meld>joy
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move. ####<meld>joy
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice ####<meld>sadness
You ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up! ####<meld>joy
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised? ####<meld>joy
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, its time to go. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? ####<meld>neutral
Twice? ####<meld>neutral
Well thats ambitious. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, uh, you can ignore that. ####<meld>neutral
Thats Carol with your son! ####<meld>surprise
Mornings here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the mornings here! The mornings here! ####<meld>joy

Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor! ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? I am ####<meld>neutral

Yep! I sure know how to pick em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this! ####<meld>sadness
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too. ####<meld>anger

Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Transit Authority? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, hello. ####<meld>neutral
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, here's the deal. ####<meld>neutral
We lost a carseat on a bus today. ####<meld>neutral
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and there was a baby in it. ####<meld>neutral
He wants to talk to you again. ####<meld>neutral

Good evening, sir. ####<meld>neutral
My name is Ross Geller. ####<meld>neutral
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. ####<meld>neutral
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry. ####<meld>neutral
I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you. ####<meld>joy
Man, I wish I was naked. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, this-this looks so great. ####<meld>joy
That is how God intended it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! ####<meld>anger
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! ####<meld>anger
Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! ####<meld>joy
Okay, you go! ####<meld>anger
My turn? What-what are you talking about? ####<meld>surprise
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler. ####<meld>disgust

Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out. ####<meld>joy
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone. ####<meld>anger
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most ####<meld>neutral
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler. ####<meld>anger

A test?!! ####<meld>surprise
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!! ####<meld>joy
Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla? ####<meld>neutral
Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him. ####<meld>neutral
Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put. ####<meld>neutral
I think its best sir. ####<meld>neutral
But we really do need to find someone up here. ####<meld>neutral
The work is starting to pile up. ####<meld>neutral
Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a good one. ####<meld>neutral

Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, for you! ####<meld>joy
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God! ####<meld>surprise
That's ####<meld>neutral
Hey, I've been honing! ####<meld>anger
What was with the dishes? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh.. ####<meld>fear
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? ####<meld>fear
I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. ####<meld>anger
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here! ####<meld>anger
Great, now he's waving back. ####<meld>disgust
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. ####<meld>disgust
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. ####<meld>disgust
It creeps me out! ####<meld>anger
I feel like I can't do stuff! ####<meld>anger
What kinda stuff? ####<meld>joy
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked. ####<meld>disgust
You cook naked? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. ####<meld>neutral
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that. ####<meld>surprise
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps. ####<meld>neutral
Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know. ####<meld>sadness
Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to. ####<meld>neutral
You think you know me so well. ####<meld>anger
Well, dont cha wanna? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well I do know you. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what I said. ####<meld>neutral
Well so? ####<meld>neutral
I cant. ####<meld>sadness
I cant. ####<meld>sadness
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone. ####<meld>sadness
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? ####<meld>neutral
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal. ####<meld>neutral
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. ####<meld>joy
Nuh-uh. ####<meld>fear
Yuh-huh. ####<meld>joy
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what? ####<meld>surprise
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. ####<meld>disgust
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my ####<meld>anger
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one? ####<meld>anger
That's the rule. ####<meld>neutral
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! ####<meld>anger
How'd you get to that? ####<meld>anger
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio ####<meld>anger
You knew about that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, ok, How about if we split it? ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean, like, buy it together? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah ####<meld>neutral
You think we're ready for something like that? ####<meld>neutral
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out? ####<meld>neutral
Why, are you moving out? ####<meld>surprise
I'm not moving out. ####<meld>neutral
You'd tell me if you were moving out right ####<meld>fear
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip... ####<meld>neutral
Aw, I know all about Kip! ####<meld>anger
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly. ####<meld>anger
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? ####<meld>sadness
Aw, don't do that ####<meld>sadness
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment. ####<meld>sadness
Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you. ####<meld>neutral
No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry! ####<meld>fear
Aw forget it, its from ####<meld>neutral
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!! ####<meld>anger
Yknow this is actually not a great time for me. ####<meld>sadness
Okay! So, well just stay married. ####<meld>joy
Yes, exactly! ####<meld>joy
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! ####<meld>joy
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more. ####<meld>joy
What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>anger
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! ####<meld>joy
Its ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, okay, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Youre right. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Im asking you to do me a favor. ####<meld>neutral
You are asking me to be your wife! ####<meld>anger
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. ####<meld>joy
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it? ####<meld>neutral
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her- ####<meld>neutral
-leg? ####<meld>neutral
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch. ####<meld>neutral
You actually broke her watch? ####<meld>surprise
Barry, I'm sorry... ####<meld>sadness
I am so sorry... ####<meld>sadness
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway... ####<meld>sadness
No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan. ####<meld>neutral
Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. ####<meld>joy
Okay, okay, bye ####<meld>neutral
So what are they doing? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, something girlie. ####<meld>joy
Hey, youre early. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing with the lamp? ####<meld>surprise
Im just taking it to be re-wired. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week. ####<meld>disgust
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here. ####<meld>neutral
Youre disturbing my oboe practice. ####<meld>anger
You dont play the oboe! ####<meld>anger
I could play the oboe! ####<meld>anger
Ohhh! That is soo sweet! ####<meld>joy
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me. ####<meld>joy
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! ####<meld>anger
What is going on? ####<meld>surprise
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!! ####<meld>anger
Ross! ####<meld>surprise
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! ####<meld>anger
What do I have to do to get some service?! ####<meld>anger
Hi Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Ross? ####<meld>neutral

Hey its Mona! From the wedding. ####<meld>joy
Oh hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Wow! Uhhow are you? ####<meld>surprise
Im good except umm, you still owe me a dance. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film? ####<meld>joy
Oh youre serious. Sure! ####<meld>surprise
Great! Well umm ####<meld>joy
I think I might need one more cup of coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. ####<meld>sadness
Go! ####<meld>anger
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is? ####<meld>surprise
I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit. ####<meld>anger
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God Oh, hes in there right now? ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, lets rip! ####<meld>fear
Really? Are you sure? ####<meld>surprise
Oh Phoebe! ####<meld>joy
Okay, sorry. Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. ####<meld>joy
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and    I wanted to share it with you. ####<meld>joy
Oh, you're so wonderful. ####<meld>joy
It can’t be me, I’m standing right here. ####<meld>neutral
Wanna peek? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>disgust
Come on! ####<meld>surprise
We’re not peeking? ####<meld>sadness
Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Hello sir, you know Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler is fantastic!! ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow how people just click? ####<meld>joy
Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! ####<meld>joy
Did he tell you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart? ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know... ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through. ####<meld>joy
Isnt this great?! ####<meld>joy
Dont spoil it. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, sweetie! ####<meld>joy
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, huh. ####<meld>neutral
I?ve got some bad news. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>fear
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here. ####<meld>neutral
Come on sweetie! You?ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time? ####<meld>sadness
But work comes first!  Oh hey, but that?s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya? ####<meld>joy
Nooo, he?s leaving for a better job. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well that?s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye. ####<meld>joy

So, see ya on Saturday. ####<meld>neutral

Whazzup?? ####<meld>neutral
Seriously dude, 3 years ago. ####<meld>joy
Listen, can you do me a favor? ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna be out today. ####<meld>neutral
Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly? ####<meld>neutral
You don't trust him? ####<meld>surprise
I think the check in is that way. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh. ####<meld>neutral
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be! ####<meld>neutral
Well theres some people who do want to marry me. ####<meld>anger
There are? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Richard! ####<meld>anger
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?! ####<meld>surprise
Thats right. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler ####<meld>neutral
You just told me that he hates marriage! ####<meld>surprise
That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! ####<meld>anger
That-that hes against marriage and always will be! ####<meld>anger
You got ####<meld>neutral
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. ####<meld>fear
I knew. ####<meld>neutral
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. ####<meld>surprise
I did. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>sadness
Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? ####<meld>fear
Sometime? ####<meld>neutral
Maybe? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, maybe... ####<meld>joy
Okay... okay, maybe I will... ####<meld>joy
Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend. ####<meld>neutral
Well, youre amazing. ####<meld>joy
Oh no-no-no. ####<meld>neutral
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? ####<meld>surprise
Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I dont know. ####<meld>fear
Oh-no-no-no, you are! ####<meld>joy
You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that. ####<meld>joy
You mean with Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool. ####<meld>neutral
Or Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Could be Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No. No, Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Consider Casey. ####<meld>neutral
I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. ####<meld>joy
How bout I fix you two up? ####<meld>joy
What do you think? ####<meld>joy
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! ####<meld>joy
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end? ####<meld>neutral
Honey, whats the matter? ####<meld>neutral
I just saw Janice. ####<meld>neutral
Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know..... ####<meld>joy
Wow! This girl is good. ####<meld>surprise
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. ####<meld>anger
I like her. ####<meld>neutral
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time? ####<meld>neutral
Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people. ####<meld>neutral
Look at you. All jealous. ####<meld>anger
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more ####<meld>neutral
Say you'll stay beside me ####<meld>sadness
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done. ####<meld>anger
Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. ####<meld>neutral
I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, hello. ####<meld>neutral
I have a question. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. ####<meld>neutral
A beard and a moustache. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
No, ####<meld>neutral
What?! What else did he say? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. ####<meld>neutral
So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, no! There is ####<meld>anger
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I am a human doodle!! ####<meld>anger
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! ####<meld>neutral
And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna ####<meld>neutral
Okay, there was ####<meld>neutral
Come on! ####<meld>joy
Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies? ####<meld>joy
No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I dont ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!! ####<meld>surprise
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade? ####<meld>neutral
So?! ####<meld>disgust
Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up! ####<meld>disgust
Oh right, right. ####<meld>neutral
I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex? ####<meld>disgust
Well usually...yeah! ####<meld>surprise
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. ####<meld>neutral
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. ####<meld>neutral
Im such a jerk. ####<meld>sadness
Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it. ####<meld>neutral
Hmmm... this is so nice. ####<meld>joy
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment. ####<meld>neutral
OK. ####<meld>neutral
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um.... ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh!!!! ####<meld>surprise
Yes, yes, that's right... ####<meld>neutral
Oh, look at the little cat! ####<meld>surprise
What?  Ow! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point. ####<meld>neutral
I didn't mean ####<meld>neutral
It's brilliant! ####<meld>joy
Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! ####<meld>joy
well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Sincerely. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help. ####<meld>joy
David, I'm pretending to ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! ####<meld>joy
Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half! ####<meld>anger
We are switching at the next rest stop and ####<meld>anger
All right. All right. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice. ####<meld>anger
Really? I dont ####<meld>surprise
Sing!! ####<meld>anger
Morning! ####<meld>joy
Everything was delicious! ####<meld>joy
Thank you! ####<meld>joy
It was. The duck in particular was superb. ####<meld>joy
Thank you!    You haven't said anything... ####<meld>joy
Actually I do have one small complaint. ####<meld>neutral
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. ####<meld>neutral
The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer! ####<meld>sadness
What musician? ####<meld>surprise
We did? ####<meld>neutral
You owe me 20 bucks. ####<meld>joy
Thank you. Thank you so much! ####<meld>joy
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. ####<meld>neutral
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? ####<meld>surprise
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? ####<meld>anger
All right, I'm nine years old. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I hate this story. ####<meld>sadness
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. ####<meld>neutral
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my god. ####<meld>surprise
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, who's this little naked guy? ####<meld>surprise
That little naked guy would be me. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, look at the little thing. ####<meld>surprise
Who are those people? ####<meld>surprise
Got me. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? ####<meld>surprise
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? ####<meld>neutral
Looks like a fun gang. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! ####<meld>joy
So, whats this about? ####<meld>joy
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater. ####<meld>neutral
No.  This is my red sweater. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay. ####<meld>fear
Whats going on Rach? ####<meld>joy
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare? ####<meld>fear
Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called. ####<meld>joy
I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together. ####<meld>joy
Oh, its just not the right time. ####<meld>sadness
It is the right time. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Kay! ####<meld>joy

Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Can he handle the stick? ####<meld>neutral
Oh well ####<meld>neutral
I can handle the stick!! ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing? ####<meld>sadness
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass? ####<meld>sadness
Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true! ####<meld>surprise
Chandler Bing! ####<meld>surprise
Janice ####<meld>surprise
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything. ####<meld>joy
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen? ####<meld>surprise
Its you. This is yours. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years! ####<meld>joy
Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt? ####<meld>fear
Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here. ####<meld>neutral
I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? Really? No ones home? ####<meld>surprise
I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there ####<meld>neutral
Hey, what's up? ####<meld>neutral
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! ####<meld>anger
You had no relationship!! ####<meld>anger
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan! ####<meld>anger
Oh God, stop with the plan! ####<meld>anger
So what, so what you saw him with a girl? ####<meld>neutral
Who cares?! ####<meld>anger
That doesn't mean anything! ####<meld>anger
Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl. ####<meld>neutral
She was kinda stupid. ####<meld>neutral
You're right. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna go on the date. ####<meld>neutral
That is the new plan. ####<meld>neutral

Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people. ####<meld>neutral
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that? ####<meld>anger
I do it every year. ####<meld>neutral
You do that every year?? ####<meld>surprise
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!! ####<meld>anger
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us?? ####<meld>anger
Yeah... ####<meld>neutral
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant? ####<meld>anger
Yeah... ####<meld>neutral
OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory? ####<meld>anger
Who's this from? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's Ross's. ####<meld>neutral
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered. ####<meld>surprise
Remembered what? ####<meld>neutral
It was like months ago. ####<meld>surprise
We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe he remembered! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe he did this. ####<meld>surprise
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? ####<meld>neutral
What did you just say? ####<meld>surprise
F-hah.... flennin.... ####<meld>fear
Oh.... my God. ####<meld>surprise
I really like waking up with you. ####<meld>joy
I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh, I can stay here all day. ####<meld>joy
That would be great! ####<meld>joy
We could have breakfast in bed ####<meld>joy
Wait, just a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Oh! Oh no. ####<meld>surprise
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from ####<meld>sadness
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  Youre Bonnie? ####<meld>surprise
I can show you an ID if you want? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you. ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that must be it. ####<meld>neutral
Well I hope you have fun tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks! You too. ####<meld>joy
I believe it. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I do. ####<meld>neutral
No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this. ####<meld>anger
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right. ####<meld>anger
I do not always have to beokay, okay. ####<meld>anger
Jurassic Park ####<meld>neutral
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night. ####<meld>fear
Maybe we should check the trash chute. ####<meld>neutral
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute. ####<meld>neutral
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
There he is! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!! ####<meld>anger
Just, y'know out. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there! ####<meld>anger
What were you doing? ####<meld>neutral
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while. ####<meld>neutral
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone. ####<meld>surprise
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want! ####<meld>anger
He hooked up!! Tell us about her! ####<meld>joy
Ross you left you scarf in Hey you guys. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, that looks good. ####<meld>neutral

Yeah, we look great together. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, we dont have to imagine. ####<meld>neutral
Im marrying her. ####<meld>joy
Well just see. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! ####<meld>anger
Hi Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! How you doin? ####<meld>neutral
He has the most amazing Porsche under there! ####<meld>joy
Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. ####<meld>neutral
Shes sleeping. ####<meld>neutral
Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? ####<meld>neutral
Well, the old lady died. ####<meld>sadness
And how do I know? ####<meld>neutral
Her dying wish was for one last kiss. ####<meld>neutral
But I dont care,  because you got the apartment. ####<meld>joy
Yes! ####<meld>joy
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here. ####<meld>disgust
Isnt that great? ####<meld>joy
Ezels!! ####<meld>disgust
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, its not your fault. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, thats great. ####<meld>joy
Oh, yeah! ####<meld>joy
Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign. ####<meld>neutral
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no. ####<meld>neutral
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up. ####<meld>joy
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, great. ####<meld>joy
You freak. ####<meld>disgust
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Um, coffee to go, please. ####<meld>neutral
Isabella Rosselini. ####<meld>neutral
Are you serious?  Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list. ####<meld>anger
Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, maybe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh, you lie. ####<meld>disgust
What you dont think Id go up to her? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. ####<meld>anger
You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, hold my crawler. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this? ####<meld>surprise
Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just sorry we dont got popcorn. ####<meld>joy
Okay, that's, that's enough. ####<meld>neutral
Won't you dance around with me. ####<meld>neutral
A-ha!!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies! ####<meld>joy
Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
It's me, Joey! ####<meld>joy
Do I know you? ####<meld>surprise
Joey! ####<meld>joy
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy. ####<meld>neutral
Okay thats fair. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Good! ####<meld>neutral
Pick one. ####<meld>neutral
Left!  Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Youre welcome. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! ####<meld>surprise
Joey!  We should just switch. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you. ####<meld>sadness
Oh thats all right! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, I ended up having a really good time. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness. ####<meld>joy
So what was it for anyway? ####<meld>neutral
I wanna say a disease. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh Professor Geller. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, to be 13 again. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets? ####<meld>neutral
No! He blew us off! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I know! ####<meld>surprise
I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now. ####<meld>anger
Can I tell you something? Me too. ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him ####<meld>anger
Ooooh! Freeze him out. ####<meld>joy
Thats right! ####<meld>joy
I like it! ####<meld>joy
Doorknob? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good. ####<meld>joy
Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. ####<meld>fear
So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet. ####<meld>sadness
Its-its too soon. ####<meld>fear
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks. ####<meld>surprise
No. I think you misunderstood what ####<meld>surprise
You are so adorable. ####<meld>joy
That! Lets talk about that. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
How do you feel? ####<meld>neutral
Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so I ####<meld>neutral
And protected them from a tornado? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
I know, the babies are asleep. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, what, what happened here?! ####<meld>surprise
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself! ####<meld>joy
But my apartment! ####<meld>surprise
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. ####<meld>neutral
Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! ####<meld>neutral
When will that be? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! ####<meld>anger
Hey Ross! The babys kicking! ####<meld>joy
What?! It is?! ####<meld>surprise
Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again. ####<meld>joy
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened? ####<meld>joy
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping ####<meld>joy
A dreamless sleep. ####<meld>neutral
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! ####<meld>joy
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! ####<meld>neutral
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
When are you coming home? ####<meld>neutral
What? Guys, I'm not. ####<meld>surprise
C'mon, this is us. ####<meld>neutral
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job- ####<meld>neutral
Waitressing? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. ####<meld>neutral
I'm.. ####<meld>neutral
I, um... ####<meld>neutral
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... ####<meld>neutral
I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies. ####<meld>sadness
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then? ####<meld>neutral
So, um, will you bring the truck? ####<meld>neutral
I'll even let you ring the bell. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, my god. ####<meld>surprise
See, there you go, the cleansing works! ####<meld>joy
They're nice guys. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, they're firemen guys. ####<meld>joy
Your son. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie. ####<meld>anger
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. ####<meld>neutral
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, ####<meld>surprise
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. ####<meld>anger
I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps. ####<meld>anger
No, you don't. ####<meld>neutral
All right, that's it. I want both of you out. ####<meld>anger
Why? ####<meld>surprise
He started it! ####<meld>anger
No, you started it. ####<meld>anger
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. ####<meld>anger
Now go! ####<meld>anger
Thanks a lot. ####<meld>anger
See what you did. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, listen... ####<meld>neutral
Out ####<meld>anger
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say? ####<meld>joy
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice. ####<meld>surprise
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. ####<meld>neutral
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times. ####<meld>neutral
You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali. ####<meld>neutral
Boutros Boutros Gali. ####<meld>neutral
He says he was too. ####<meld>neutral
Interesting. ####<meld>neutral
So I was wondering.... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit. ####<meld>joy
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. ####<meld>joy
So you're a chef? ####<meld>neutral
Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant. ####<meld>joy
Oh, really. ####<meld>surprise
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I was having a conversation. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other. ####<meld>anger
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation? ####<meld>anger
That would be great. Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera! ####<meld>disgust
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. ####<meld>neutral
When did that happen to you?! ####<meld>surprise
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera! ####<meld>neutral
