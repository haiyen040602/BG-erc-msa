Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's my point too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon. ####<iemocap>frustrated
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, they do. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know. ####<iemocap>excited
It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this. ####<iemocap>excited
All right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life... ####<iemocap>frustrated
And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We just weren't in a good spot though. ####<iemocap>neutral
Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it... ####<iemocap>neutral
Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way... ####<iemocap>excited
They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction... ####<iemocap>excited
They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming... ####<iemocap>excited
Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one... ####<iemocap>excited
And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here... ####<iemocap>excited
It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind. ####<iemocap>excited
It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm. ####<iemocap>excited
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
I think it's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's a PR. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They're all told the same thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Their life will start then. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry it still just fish to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever? ####<iemocap>angry
Twice is every year we've tried that's ever. ####<iemocap>angry
No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus. ####<iemocap>angry
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married. ####<iemocap>neutral
And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to. ####<iemocap>angry
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting. ####<iemocap>angry
This isn't anything like I thought anything would be. ####<iemocap>sadness
This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that Augie, I really do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that? ####<iemocap>neutral
You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death... ####<iemocap>excited
Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so?  What do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We missed them twice. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards ####<iemocap>frustrated
and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go." ####<iemocap>neutral
So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait a minute, I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh right sure, of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
You want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want to take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>neutral
What? Huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
You want to get married again? ####<iemocap>neutral
What?  What?  You want to divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, welcome to the human race. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No. ####<iemocap>angry
No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and-- ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know me neither. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too? ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Look what we got here. ####<iemocap>joy
It's not champagne. ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home? ####<iemocap>neutral
Shh... ####<iemocap>joy
If we are really quiet, the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
What we're going to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now and always sweet. ####<iemocap>joy
It had to happen sooner or later. ####<iemocap>joy
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>excited
Oh. Behave exquisitely... ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Mmm... ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, yes meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious. ####<iemocap>joy
Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too. ####<iemocap>joy
How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours? ####<iemocap>joy
Shall we always want to bicker and fight? ####<iemocap>joy
If one of us dies... ####<iemocap>joy
I think you're talking nonsense. ####<iemocap>joy
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
Cannes...mmhmm... ####<iemocap>joy
The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh... ####<iemocap>joy
Utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>joy
oh...[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh you knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>excited
Good God. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
We're okay, right darling?  Whatever happens, we're okay? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>joy
With perfect poise... ####<iemocap>joy
Ah... ####<iemocap>joy
Ah...Strange... ####<iemocap>joy
Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they? ####<iemocap>joy
Darling, don't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god? ####<iemocap>joy
You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want. ####<iemocap>joy
Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light. ####<iemocap>joy
We are figures of fun all right ####<iemocap>joy
Ahh...who knows. ####<iemocap>joy
Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Come here darling, kiss me ####<iemocap>excited
before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>joy
See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you remember that row we did have in Venice? ####<iemocap>joy
But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown. ####<iemocap>excited
I will never forget the look on his face. ####<iemocap>joy
oh... ####<iemocap>joy
We were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>joy
Presents? It was a trivial little broach. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
No, thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses. ####<iemocap>angry
Don't be stupid, what? ####<iemocap>angry
Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you? ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I did quite a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, mind you own business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy? ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
They are away in Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it on again, please. ####<iemocap>angry
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop it. No. Go away. ####<iemocap>angry
listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast. ####<iemocap>angry
I'll have a little, I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses. ####<iemocap>neutral
Really, Amanda. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are you going out somewhere dear? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder. ####<iemocap>angry
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? ####<iemocap>angry
I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too. ####<iemocap>angry
I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how. ####<iemocap>angry
I am not in the least bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots. ####<iemocap>angry
That's a very good idea I think I will. ####<iemocap>angry
Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs. ####<iemocap>angry
Well then you'll wake the people downstairs. ####<iemocap>angry
This is no time a year for Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
I will do no such thing. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. It's driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Amanda listen. Listen. ####<iemocap>angry
That's very amusing indeed. ####<iemocap>angry
You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going like this. ####<iemocap>angry
No you're not. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration. ####<iemocap>neutral
My--my original birth certificate?  But I don't carry that with me. ####<iemocap>neutral
No it doesn't say it on the form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean if I had known--I would have brought it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time.  I mean, you've seen how long it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's lunch hour. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I can give you my social-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I can give you my Social Security Number. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well.  [BREATHING] I just--I just don't.  I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I really need this done today.  As you can see, the deadline is almost up and I can't come back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then? ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that. ####<iemocap>angry
With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else. ####<iemocap>angry
Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you have a supervisor? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hi. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Well.  We still need it. ####<iemocap>neutral
um Sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, I'm sorry but I--I can't help you.  You're gonna have to go back and uh... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right.  It's the D.M.V.. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright, I don't know what to tell you right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I make an exception for you and I have to make an exception for everyone.  I mean, I-I've seen this before and I know it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do. You just have to- ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, it's-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting ####<iemocap>angry
I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know, Official documentation-- ####<iemocap>angry
No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am the supervisor.  So-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's almost time for me to go. ####<iemocap>sadness
There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know-- ####<iemocap>sadness
You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't think so. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile. ####<iemocap>sadness
You could send me pictures. ####<iemocap>sadness
Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all-- ####<iemocap>sadness
and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and-- ####<iemocap>sadness
You can just remember it for me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger. ####<iemocap>sadness
I have no choice. There's nothing I can do. ####<iemocap>sadness
What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here.  Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, come on.  You've gotta think of something.  A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart.  I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it.  I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words.  For her first steps.  I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh my God.  Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what? ####<iemocap>excited
Well, guess.  Guess, guess, guess, guess. ####<iemocap>excited

'Cause- 'Cause he was with me. You didn't do it did you? ####<iemocap>excited
You didn't know anything? ####<iemocap>excited
I was just--it was so like I thought this might happen eventually, but like not yet, you know what I mean?  Like-- ####<iemocap>excited
It is good.  It's totally good.  I mean, it like oh, you know. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. So we're gonna take it--Like we're not gonna get married right away--'Cause we want to like have plenty of time to plan everything out ####<iemocap>joy
...and, um, my parents want to like be part of it and help out and everything--So we want to give it lots of time to like-- ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, yeah, I called them. I called them And, of course, they were so excited 'cause they love him. Like they always have.  Um-- ####<iemocap>joy
So, yeah, I mean, it'll be good.  We wanna like, uh, I think we're gonna have it in spring time, like early Spring--So it's no too hot yet.  And um-- ####<iemocap>joy

Of course, of course--you'll be able to be a part of it.  You can come help me pick my colors. ####<iemocap>joy
It's so girly.  I don't even know how to like--It's so weird, but it'll be fun.  My mom will love to be like--she'll get so into it, I'm sure. ####<iemocap>excited

So, I mean--it's good though. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, I know.  Wow.  I'm shaking.  I can't even-- ####<iemocap>excited
Oh. Do they--do they know yet? Have you told them? Oh, that's-- ####<iemocap>neutral
That's great.  Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. You know--you know where?  Or-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, huh. I mean, you know, it's spring--It'll be-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Spring's nice though. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, that is--how long you guys been together now? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  All right.  So-[LAUGHTER]-quite a while.  I mean--That's-  That's good.  I'm so happy for you. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, I'd love to be in that same situation some day, but, wow- so- ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, I approve. I-[LAUGHTER]-I more than approve. ####<iemocap>joy
I mean, I'm surprised he didn't, ya know--go get a plane to fly over and shine--But candles on the beach, that's okay too I guess-- ####<iemocap>joy
Well--can--I mean, let me know--I want- I want invitations and-- ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, yes.  This is the whole [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>excited
It'll be good.  Wow, that's great. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again.  Like-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's.  Like, I don't-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like, it just takes it out of you-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I feel so worthless. ####<iemocap>sadness
And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Or they'll never talk to me again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but ####<iemocap>frustrated
you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning. ####<iemocap>sadness
So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything? ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't ####<iemocap>neutral
No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive. ####<iemocap>neutral
There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot... ####<iemocap>neutral
...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and... ####<iemocap>neutral
... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know ####<iemocap>neutral
Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>frustrated
That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you've gotta live. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Some problems?  What is that supposed to mean? ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you lose a suitcase?  A huge suitcase? ####<iemocap>neutral
How much? ####<iemocap>neutral
Fifty dollars?  For my suitcase?  I mean, the suitcase itself was like a hundred and fifty dollar just for the suitcase, but all the things inside, all my clothes, all my personal belongings, the sentimental value, not to mention, which is more-more than all of that together. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff? ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because you don't seem to care very much, you know. ####<iemocap>angry
I didn't sign anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Isn't there anything else you can do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
There needs to be better security here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Thank you very much. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh- ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do. ####<iemocap>neutral
I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um ####<iemocap>neutral
By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the-- ####<iemocap>neutral
You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you ####<iemocap>neutral
probably even talk to-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh ####<iemocap>neutral
but Unfortunately sometimes is-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, that's--that's what I'm saying-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, Johnny died yesterday. ####<iemocap>sadness

It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean--I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than... ####<iemocap>neutral
.than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, exactly.  He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and ####<iemocap>neutral
And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No, you'll never forget him. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside-- ####<iemocap>neutral
That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so . ####<iemocap>neutral
It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now. ####<iemocap>neutral
I got into U.S.C. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say-- ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway. ####<iemocap>excited
So-- ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I know. ####<iemocap>excited
Absolutely. I'm so excited. ####<iemocap>excited

and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like... ####<iemocap>excited
You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C. ####<iemocap>excited

...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean? ####<iemocap>excited
Like it has some prestige. so ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine-- ####<iemocap>excited
Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know-- ####<iemocap>excited
Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know ####<iemocap>excited
I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited. ####<iemocap>excited

Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first... ####<iemocap>excited
...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean? ####<iemocap>excited

Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, sir. ####<iemocap>neutral
I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time. ####<iemocap>neutral
I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous, ####<iemocap>neutral
um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here. ####<iemocap>neutral
Is that all right? ####<iemocap>neutral
I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end. ####<iemocap>neutral
All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So- ####<iemocap>neutral
um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely. we we ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves. ####<iemocap>neutral
So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Great.  How many seats? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like? ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that. ####<iemocap>neutral
So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare. ####<iemocap>neutral
And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again. ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, hello. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, I'm sorry.  It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and- ####<iemocap>frustrated
You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] that's good. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. So-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a ####<iemocap>neutral
--you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, it's gonna be four of them. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  And can they like all get together? ####<iemocap>neutral
Um- You know, window is nice. I guess ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know-- ####<iemocap>neutral
And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
He cried hard? ####<iemocap>sadness
What was he doing out here at that hour? ####<iemocap>sadness
What do you want to do argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can you prove it?  How can you prove it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've got an idea, but what's the story? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, that's only your business, Chris. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm just saying that-- ####<iemocap>neutral
From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does. ####<iemocap>neutral
Trouble is, you don't see enough women. ####<iemocap>sadness
You never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--give it some more thought. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
What about the business?  What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can see that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now? ####<iemocap>angry
We've got to say it to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane. ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm gonna ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not only my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's all right then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, then it isn't just my business-- ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Because it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  All right, then, Mom. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it. ####<iemocap>angry
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, on this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am thinkin' that way. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>neutral
-he's not gonna marry her. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's got that all about it. ####<iemocap>angry
Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited. ####<iemocap>frustrated
She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but... ####<iemocap>angry
But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it. ####<iemocap>angry
Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You, above all, have to believe. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just--just don't stop believing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
