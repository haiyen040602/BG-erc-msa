A lot of sad parts ####<neu><score>-0.5
There is sad part ####<neg><score>-1.2
And its a really funny ####<pos><score>1.8
But it was really really awesome ####<pos><score>2.2
Anyhow it was really good ####<pos><score>2.4
I mean they did a little bit of it ####<neg><score>-1.0
Thay did they didnt really do a whole bunch of background info on why she has to fight and be prepared ####<neg><score>-0.8
And they shouldve i guess ####<neu><score>0.0
But not a whole bunch ####<neg><score>-1.75
And xxx but besides that it was all over pretty good ####<pos><score>0.8
They shouldve live up with more ####<neu><score>0.0
Oh my god a lot of action ####<pos><score>0.2
And there is like someone while someone there was a lot of action ####<neu><score>0.0
I mean that was impressive ####<pos><score>2.6
I liked that scene where he had a swords in there and theres bunch of people that are gonna shoot him boom boom boom boom take him down take him down bam bam bam bam bam take that with my magical swords ####<pos><score>2.2
Ok but the two big character appearances in this movie are easily deadpool and gambit ####<pos><score>0.6
Actually i liked him a lot ####<pos><score>2.0
And i thought he made a good actor for the dead poor character ####<pos><score>1.8
Now hes seen at the beginning that really sold me ####<pos><score>2.6
Now the title of the movie basically says it all ####<neg><score>-0.4
My reason im a comic book fan ####<neg><score>-0.2
Now im not even gonna sugar coat this this movie frustrated me to such an extreme extent that i was loudly exclaiming why at the end of the film ####<neg><score>-2.8
That huh before we go on with that i must say that this had a surprisingly decent cast ####<pos><score>0.8
That like to see comic book characters treated responsibly ####<neg><score>-1.4
Now hugh jackman was always the best choice to play wolverine i will admit that ####<pos><score>1.8
Strange since one of my biggest grapes with the xman series was and always is the xxx ####<neg><score>-1.4
You know nothing great ####<neg><score>-1.0
And in my opinion he carried the movie fine ####<pos><score>0.8
Hes a star of the movie ####<pos><score>0.4
But you know he did it ####<neg><score>-0.6
He carried it ####<pos><score>1.25
Nothing special ####<neg><score>-0.8
But its pretty selfexplanatory ####<neu><score>0.0
Which is a smart move since you know you have to be real comic book fan to get what hes name is supposed to be ####<pos><score>1.4
And he almost looks exactly the same as this character in defiance ####<pos><score>0.2
Um i actually think that liev schreiber is a good actor ####<pos><score>0.6
Now other performances are borderline ####<neg><score>-0.4
I mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something ####<neg><score>-2.0
But for me i was just a little bored ####<neg><score>-1.8
Kids are gonna love the film ####<pos><score>2.6
But otherwise i dont know ####<neg><score>-1.25
Sure there were cute money parts in the mixting of the film ####<pos><score>0.4
I didnt even care for it ####<neg><score>-2.0
But for this one i just didnt feel like it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Because it had a real nostalgic feel to it ####<pos><score>1.0
Um i loved the very first alvin and the chipmunks movie ####<pos><score>1.6
But you know for this one i just didnt care ####<neg><score>-1.8
It reminded me of getting up on a saturday morning and eating fruit loops and um watching cartoons ####<pos><score>2.0
And um while the trailer made the film look real nice and cute ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um i saw no reason why they needed to bring back the villain from the first one ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um im sure kids are gonna love it ####<pos><score>2.2
It was just flat ####<neg><score>-1.8
And you knew you shouldnt be laughing ####<neg><score>-1.0
My favorite scene would definately be the volturi ####<pos><score>2.0
Um then my wins on screen wiskers i mean they were really worn in a lots which is a shame because i thought xxx really rather good ####<neg><score>-0.6
And um michael sheen as aro as well he was rather enjoyable to watch ####<pos><score>1.8
And the script it left all the key plots and emotion from the characters to be exposed through dialogue ####<pos><score>0.4
I think it was empire magazines review of new moon that said that kristen relied heavily on the tactic of tactic of blinking a lot which she really does do a lot ####<neg><score>-0.4
But at the same goes for rob pattinson as edward and taylor lautner as jacob they do a lot of frowning im a manly man and i frown ####<neg><score>-0.2
For the moment in this the whole cinema was laughting ####<pos><score>1.8
And i think the volturi that was my exciting bit of the entire film ####<pos><score>1.2
The rest of the film was just watching kristen just mob around ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i thought they were average ####<neg><score>-0.4
I thought twilight directed by catherine hardwicke was actually really rather enjoyable ####<pos><score>2.0
Lets face it they are really not master pieces ####<neg><score>-1.75
But cinematicly i thought it was good quite good ####<pos><score>2.2
Um i mean obviously it had its flaws ####<neg><score>-1.2
I wasnt thinking on hearing that chris weitz was gonna start the new moon because of the destruction that was phillip pullman the golden compass ####<neg><score>-0.6
It wasit was enjoyable ####<pos><score>1.6
And i i didint really know what to expect from new moon um in terms of his direction ####<neg><score>-0.2
I thought that film was awful ####<neg><score>-2.4
The thing is its a very good translation of the book ####<pos><score>2.2
Overall new moon was it was ok just average ####<pos><score>0.6
And i really appreciate that loyalty ####<pos><score>1.4
Its very very loyal to the book ####<pos><score>1.6
And the book is not necessarily the most thrilling book ever ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um however it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws ####<neg><score>-0.2
It wasnt really the best the most thrilling read ever ill say that ####<neg><score>-1.4
I mean the entire xxx is bella swan kristen kristens stewards character mobbing around completely depressed ####<neg><score>-1.4
The angsty too angsty moments withdrawn out to the max as far as thay can go ####<neg><score>-1.0
So overallnew moon even with the bigger better budgets huh it was still too long ####<neg><score>-1.8
And that was really boring ####<neg><score>-1.6
Like a movie called cowboys and aliens a lot of people would think would be kind of like crazy ####<neg><score>-0.4
I just thought it was kind of stupid ####<neg><score>-2.0
So you can care about him ####<neu><score>0.0
There are some flaws here ####<neg><score>-1.0
And alsoum olivia wild shes pretty good ####<pos><score>2.0
And im gonna give it an eight out of ten ####<pos><score>2.2
It was really fun ####<pos><score>1.4
A very good time ####<pos><score>2.2
And i definately recommend you check it out in theaters ####<pos><score>2.2
And there but theyre not huge glaring flaws ####<neg><score>-0.6
But i was kind of expecting that ####<neu><score>0.0
I wasnt a huge fan of it ####<neg><score>-1.0
And also i like how its kind of upfront to show them to us instead of hiding them like showing a little like an arm on scene or something no they just straight up show it to us ####<pos><score>1.6
And i really enjoyed that ####<pos><score>1.8
I it was really cool when they did that ####<pos><score>1.8
Coz the aliens were really cool looking ####<pos><score>1.8
They are huge ####<pos><score>1.0
Theyre really strong ####<pos><score>0.8
And theyre kind of scary looking ####<neg><score>-0.8
I didnt expect that ####<neu><score>0.0
Shes actually pretty good ####<pos><score>1.4
Shes in everything nowadays ####<neu><score>0.0
Shes beautiful ####<pos><score>0.2
And shes not a bad actor ####<pos><score>0.2
Daniel craig does a very good job here ####<pos><score>2.4
He kind of channels the man with no name clint eastwood ####<pos><score>0.6
But he becomes more likeable ####<pos><score>0.6
His guts developed more as more likeable character ####<pos><score>0.6
Much say that i really enjoyed cowboys and aliens ####<pos><score>2.0
You guys dont know what youre gonna go and see when you go walk into the movie called cowboys and aliens ####<neu><score>0.0
There was a lot of fun ####<pos><score>0.4
The only oscar that i can even thing of is maybe like best cinematography ####<neu><score>0.0
If youre expecting some artsy serious oscar contender than youre wrong ####<neg><score>-0.4
And maybe best visual effects ####<pos><score>1.6
Because the cinematography in this movie is great ####<pos><score>2.4
But again you you cant expect a huge like surreal mind bender from the movie called cowboys and aliens yo ####<neg><score>-0.4
Coz the visual effects are pretty cool ####<pos><score>1.8
Such as sometimes the aliens in the western setting do look a little goofy ####<neg><score>-0.6
At first hes just kind of like grumpy old guy ####<neg><score>-0.6
Hes he gives an entertaining performance as the kind of like the leader the of the town ####<pos><score>1.0
Overall i really enjoyed cowboys and aliens ####<pos><score>2.0
Not a huge flaw but its there and its noticable ####<neg><score>-1.4
The action is really intense which surprised me ####<pos><score>2.2
And its satisfactory ####<pos><score>0.8
Theres some really intense action scenes especially the scene when the aliens first invade ####<pos><score>2.0
I didnt expect the action to be so intense ####<pos><score>1.2
It gave me chills ####<pos><score>0.5
That scene is like crazy ####<pos><score>0.2
The action is really cool ####<pos><score>2.6
I its a lot of fun ####<pos><score>2.0
One thing i like with the aliens is that a they are not just weak links that hide behind the technology ####<pos><score>1.4
The aliens are really cool ####<pos><score>2.2
I think he does a great job at what he does ####<pos><score>2.0
And a lot of people have been saying that ####<neg><score>-0.2
Harrison ford is also good ####<pos><score>1.4
Also his innocent accent is pretty convincing ####<pos><score>1.2
And he does a really good job ####<pos><score>2.2
He doesnt take crap from anybody ####<pos><score>0.6
Is really really hard core ####<pos><score>1.2
And sometimes it kind of veers into cliche action movie territory ####<neg><score>-1.0
Hes a really bad ass ####<pos><score>2.2
But sometimes it just veers entirely cliche action movie territory again ####<neg><score>-1.6
But they are noticable flaws ####<neg><score>-1.8
But then you kind of like walk out of the movie and youre like well i i get what happened i understand what happened ####<neg><score>-1.0
But what what would you do for green lantern movie 2 that would be even like worth while now ####<neg><score>-0.8
Because i mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how youre supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or or destroy him at the same time ####<neu><score>0.0
And it does kind of a lea helps alleviate what that whole was is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking ####<pos><score>1.4
But i think there was also some sort of like um tone within the actual um powers of the green lantern and himself and that you can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life ####<pos><score>0.8
And i think having this sort of superpower almost this power to just imagine anything kind of just um helped me get passed that you know these are all cgi characters and set ####<pos><score>1.0
This is a playground and their imaginary playground and anything can happen anything that what also made the film exciting ####<pos><score>2.2
Because you dont entirely know whats coming next ####<pos><score>0.2
So its kind of interesting to see um where theyre gonna be going with that ####<pos><score>1.6
Im looking forward to it ive got to say ####<pos><score>2.0
Before i went in to see the green lantern ive been hearing all these like critics basically just trashing this movie left and right ####<neg><score>-0.5
I enjoyed it for what it was you know ####<pos><score>1.4
But i at the same time i do wanna just say that i enjoyed this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
This is a movie that youre gonna go out and see ####<pos><score>2.0
Its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for this summer time you know ####<pos><score>2.2
Because i i would actually say this probably is one of the first movies this year that ive seen this year that you wanna see in 3d especially for just the opening portion ####<pos><score>2.4
And you wanna see it in 3d ####<pos><score>2.0
And the rest of it does look good as well ####<pos><score>1.4
It looks really good ####<pos><score>1.8
Its not like a dark movie or anything ####<pos><score>0.2
And i just had fun watching this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
So its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just wanna see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff ####<pos><score>2.2
Its very much a light hearted ####<pos><score>1.2
Because it looks like a cartoon ####<neg><score>-1.5
And you know going into it or these watching the trailers before head i was really kind of hesitant about seeing the green lantern in the first place ####<neg><score>-1.0
Because i think why not just make this you know movie this live action movie and talk cartoon ####<neg><score>-0.6
Im not really a huge fan of having like all these 3d characters ####<neg><score>-1.6
And it seemed like they were gonna go that route ####<neu><score>0.0
Thats really the route that youre gonna go ####<pos><score>0.333333333333
Its not like the green lantern is the next batman begins or or the dark nighter ####<neg><score>-0.4
Yeap absolutely not to be missed ####<pos><score>2.4
Its extremly well made ####<pos><score>2.8
Its extremly dare i say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way ####<pos><score>2.0
Its extremly dare i say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way and even now its a horror film ####<pos><score>1.6
Its definately got some fun kevin smith moments in it for you to laugh with um ####<pos><score>1.8
Probably one of the ballsiest probably one of the ballsiest fims od sundance 2011 ####<pos><score>2.0
Its bold ####<pos><score>0.8
Um as really the best way to describe this film is its big ####<pos><score>1.4
It makes big powerfuls statements ####<pos><score>2.0
Its strong ####<pos><score>0.4
Everything from the way its being released to the performances and to the story itself is absolutely ovrt the top impressive ####<pos><score>2.2
It doesnt hold back ####<pos><score>0.5
Its a huge break through for kevin smith ####<pos><score>2.4
And really well done ####<pos><score>2.6
John goodman absolutely amazing ####<pos><score>2.6
Its completely different from anything weve ever seen him do before ####<pos><score>0.4
Its so well done ####<pos><score>2.6
Melissa leo will have you creeped out to your inner core with her tiny little smile ####<pos><score>0.8
Its a horror film ia a true sense ####<pos><score>0.25
For all of those people who are hating on it i dont know what they are complaining about it ####<pos><score>1.8
Um it is it is definately one of those films thats not gonna be easy for you to find ####<pos><score>0.2
And it is absolutely horrifying ####<neg><score>-2.0
Whenever it comes to your town do not miss it ####<pos><score>2.8
Its being released in a very interesting way ####<pos><score>1.2
And i think i why i would be scared is because i would feel scared and kind of sad if i lost my own mother ####<neg><score>-1.2
I am eight years old and i thought it was really s kind of scary ####<pos><score>0.6
But it all turns out great in the end ####<pos><score>2.4
I just got finished watching an excellent movie called mars needs moms ####<pos><score>3.0
I liked gribble because he helped milo get milos mother away from the alians ####<pos><score>1.8
And my favorite characters in the movie would have to be milo milos mother and gribble ####<pos><score>2.0
And my favorite part in the movie was when milo has to save gribble ####<pos><score>2.2
Which i thought was awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
Because it is a good movie ####<pos><score>2.2
And i would recommend this movie for ages 3 and up ####<pos><score>2.0
Like for example my brother is five years old and he didnt think this movie was scary at all ####<neg><score>-0.4
And it depends what age you are and how you to how you feel like see the movie ####<pos><score>0.8
Beacuse i wanted to see how they could frame that ####<pos><score>0.25
Um that was probably part of the trailer that got me to go and see the movie ####<pos><score>0.4
Its a great one ####<pos><score>2.2
So um if you havent seen winnie the pooh and you like family films go see it ####<pos><score>1.8
I definately recommend it ####<pos><score>2.2
And so i was kind of curious to see maybe if that was what disney was going for and it definately was what thay were going for ####<pos><score>1.6
Um its its great if you remember that was old films ####<pos><score>2.0
But i bet if you put them next to the new film that the style would be similar enough that you wouldnt be able to really tell what the difference is ####<pos><score>0.6
The story is pretty simple ####<neu><score>0.0
Would be great for kids too ####<pos><score>2.0
Um funny jokes that the kids would get ####<pos><score>0.8
Weve got great jokes ####<pos><score>1.6
Because he says issue and they think he is saying at you ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um i love the scene where eeyore and pooh think that owl is getting sick ####<pos><score>2.0
And but xxx were too hollywood for me ####<neg><score>-1.2
The numbers they and they kind of stuck to the book of it so i like that ####<pos><score>1.4
Because think about it if you if your top priority is survival than why would you be worried about having the latest technology you know what i mean ####<neg><score>-0.6
Like th this thing isnt really a big deal but um i i ddint like the fact that john had an iphone ####<neg><score>-1.2
But my opinin like he shouldnt have an iphone he shouldnt care about the latest trends so thats really what the lieutenant xxx ####<neg><score>-1.6
So since were not really sure what their financial situation is they could be like scraping by or they could be totally rich ####<neu><score>0.0
Um like i said it wasnt big deal ####<neg><score>-0.4
I thought it was all too commercial in that aspect ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um another thing that did bother me were the kissings ####<neg><score>-1.2
And you probably dont think so but you know just one of those little things that that hurt you for some reason you know what i mean ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um so there are things that i liked about the movie better than i liked about the book and vice verse ####<pos><score>1.0
Maybe because number four was not my all time favorite book ####<neg><score>-0.8
It wasnt like it wasnt like oh the book was so much harder than movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
But but um i wasnt crazy about it ####<neg><score>-0.8
It was a good book ####<pos><score>1.6
So i liked the movie ####<pos><score>1.4
So yeah and the movie was pretty good in my opinion ####<pos><score>1.8
Good job of explaining thing with lorain the mogadorians ####<pos><score>0.5
Because it did a good job of explaining the back story in the book ####<pos><score>1.8
Um he was awesome ####<pos><score>2.4
Like he was incredible ####<pos><score>2.6
The other guy that did a really good job was um jeffrey dean morgan ####<pos><score>1.8
He did a very good job ####<pos><score>2.0
Ill tell you who made the movie ####<pos><score>0.8
Who was just kick ass 100 of time was the guy that played our rorschach ####<pos><score>1.8
But anyways he was awesome ####<pos><score>2.6
I thought that was very cool ####<pos><score>2.4
Very dark ####<neg><score>-1.25
Um i really liked sicko guy ####<neg><score>-1.5
Um graphics were incredible ####<pos><score>1.8
Some really sucky acting ####<neg><score>-2.6
Um some really good acting ####<pos><score>2.2
Coz people were like eating popcorn and you see the first show and people you hear like this this ripple effect of whispering oh my god is that a is that am i looking at this right what ####<pos><score>1.0
So this was pretty funny ####<pos><score>1.4
Um there couldve been less blue nudity ####<neg><score>-1.6
I thought that was really funny ####<pos><score>1.6
It was funny though ####<pos><score>1.8
Because what was weird was the fact that in part of the movie hes wearing like a blue um overall flong thing medal flong thing so i was like why not wear the whole whole time you know why why you got to go command on us ####<neg><score>-1.2
But um you know overall it was good ####<pos><score>1.8
Um so at the end theres not really a whole lot of redeeming value that i think you come up with ####<neg><score>-1.8
Its kind of weird ####<neg><score>-1.0
Hes funny ####<pos><score>2.0
All right so enough of the nudity ####<neg><score>-1.6
I dont know classic superhero kind of getting on kind of thing ####<pos><score>0.6
Um junior lady girl i know i i mean she looked fan fantastic ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um but what sucked what was bad was malin akerman the girl who plays the silk spectre ii ####<neg><score>-2.2
She looked like a superhero ####<pos><score>0.8
She looked phenomenal ####<pos><score>2.2
And theres a vast difference between those two things ####<neg><score>-0.2
But she acted like power ranger ####<neg><score>-0.4
I was very impressed ####<pos><score>2.2
But um he did a really good job at acting ####<pos><score>2.2
And it seemed like everything was sort of overwhelmingly bad ####<neg><score>-1.6
And um theres not in my opinion there wasnt very much of a balance between sort of like the good evil kind of thing ####<neg><score>-1.6
I warn you its a very very dark ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um but its extremely dark ####<neg><score>-0.6
And its very very interesting ####<pos><score>1.4
So overall its its like a blend of youve got alternative history ####<pos><score>0.6
Overall overall it had far too many plot holes ####<neg><score>-1.8
And just not enough depth to be interesting ####<neg><score>-2.2
I have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character thompson ####<pos><score>2.0
But hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life he stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them ####<neg><score>-1.0
Which is where all great relationships should start ####<pos><score>0.4
I literally said out loud what que what is this movie that i am seeing what is this ####<neg><score>-2.4
And just its very its very chaotic at the end of this movie ####<neg><score>-1.0
But theres a reason for that theres a reason for why i was confused ####<neg><score>-0.2
I do not understand this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
Thanks a lot commercial ####<neg><score>-1.4
First off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thought provoking than inception ####<neg><score>-2.6
But i must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so i thought maybe it has a chance ####<pos><score>0.4
The entire time i was constantly comparing it to inception ####<neg><score>-0.2
I was just waiting for joseph gordon levitt to come out just jump out any time and say its a paradox ####<neg><score>-0.5
I i should give it a shot you know ####<pos><score>0.6
Which kind of just ruins the suspense right there because if youve got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustement bureau and this is what we do you know its just kind of ruins the suspense ####<neg><score>-2.2
Now the only suspensful part that i found in the first thirty minutes of the movie was when matt damon first discovers the bureau in the first place ####<neg><score>-0.8
Interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller ####<neu><score>0.0
And now im not im not excited anymore ####<neg><score>-1.4
You know it was it was funny at times ####<pos><score>1.0
Um you know it had some interesting writing ####<pos><score>0.6
But just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the suspensful parts ####<neg><score>-2.2
Matt damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy ####<pos><score>1.4
But he actually found um when hes seen come up it slowed the movie down um and this is the problem um with predator to predators compared to predator ####<neg><score>-1.4
Predator is really well paced movie ####<pos><score>1.8
And it picks up speed and never lets go ev even in the same xxx where they they slow you know they meant to have some dialogue and and talk about whats going on yo you know ####<pos><score>1.0
It felt the movie slowed down wheres it in the middle of this ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um he had some funny he had a few one lines that was quite quite funny ####<pos><score>1.2
Yeah once unfortunately um i think in the writing somewhere they they just werent um developed enough fear to care about them um and that includes is it topher graces i think i think his name was includs his character um ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um i just didnt think it was well developed enough and um i also i i include in that laurence fishburnes character as well ####<neg><score>-1.0
Who i think rodrigez when he wrote the mo wrote the movie was going for a marlon brando apocalipse now type of character ####<neg><score>-0.4
When when they they with um laurence fishburne character it does slow down a great deal ####<neg><score>-0.8
I didnt really feel um the inclusion of his charater was necessary ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um im gonna give the reasons why i like him ####<pos><score>1.2
Um which i think rodrigez was going for he th th he always said that he was gonna do the sequel um he wanted this to be um th the predator equivalent of aliens ####<neg><score>-0.2
But mostly im gonna give the reasons of why i dont think hes gonna be a classic in the same way as the first movie predator or aliens ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um and im gonna really point out why that i dont think he really pulled he pulled that off ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um as um you know as aliens was to alien ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um but i did enjoy it ####<pos><score>0.2
Um why was a mistake really to try and do that ####<neg><score>-1.5
The characters were well developed um not all of the characters ####<pos><score>1.4
So um im gonna point out the stuff i did like there were some action scenes in it ####<pos><score>1.2
Um i i liked agent brodys character ####<pos><score>1.6
But um i would say that um there was theres good there were four good characters in there ####<pos><score>0.6
You know well drawn out character ####<pos><score>1.4
I thought he was um well developed ####<pos><score>1.6
I liked the girl who was the israeli sniper ####<pos><score>0.8
Someone you cared about ####<neu><score>0.0
Um i liked the russian guy juri ####<pos><score>1.0
I thought she was the number one well drawn character ####<pos><score>1.2
And xxx was an interesting character ####<pos><score>1.6
Um you cared you there was enough in there for you to care about him ####<pos><score>0.6
Um it couldve been written out ####<neg><score>-0.8
I mean this movie makes um makes um star wars pretty close ####<neu><score>0.0
I mean its its about that level star war is ####<pos><score>0.2
Pretty close as far as just cgi heavy like this time its what its like human face and everything around that face is cartoon cgi computer effects ####<neg><score>-1.2
And thats because about half way through the movie i realized that this is just its really just a cartoon ####<neg><score>-0.8
If you look at it as a live action movie you youre gonna be disappointed ####<neg><score>-2.0
But if you look at it as a cartoon which is pretty much mostly is with all the cgi fx ####<neg><score>-1.0
And and there is a lot of it ####<neg><score>-0.333333333333
And um i have to admit i was watching this i purposly put it on because i figured it would be something that would be stupid that i could fall asleep in the middle of and not miss too much ####<neg><score>-1.4
So i didnt didnt have very high expectations for this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
Just wanted something to watch while i was falling asleep ####<neg><score>-0.4
Because i three major complaints i have about this movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i um pretty much it pretty much met my low expectations for the most part ####<neg><score>-1.4
And um the story was pretty weird ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um biggest one is the cgi effects were just terrible ####<neg><score>-2.6
And might have been it might have made more sense ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um and again i i if i had to pay closer attention i might have followed it more ####<neg><score>-0.8
Which i mean for a movie about ji joe ninty minutes is enough ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um um this movie this movie um by half way through i was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long ####<neg><score>-2.2
But thats just me ####<neg><score>-0.333333333333
Ok i dont need a three hour mini xxx about ji joe ####<neg><score>-2.0
And the last big thing was um just the the it it i know its about jijoe you know obviously its gonna be about the army but it just felt like um like um military propaganda kind of like you know ####<neg><score>-1.6
I thought that two hours was way too long for this movie ####<neg><score>-1.8
Of course its too much ####<neg><score>-0.666666666667
It fell like i was watching one of those army of one commercials sometimes ####<neg><score>-1.0
I i guess um but the funny thing is um i mean funny thing is despite as despite everything bad about this movie i ended up half way liking it ####<pos><score>0.6
Of course its gonna be making them look good just fine ####<pos><score>0.6
And i i always think thats hilarious ####<pos><score>1.2
But what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humour jabs ####<pos><score>2.0
I thought it was really cool ####<pos><score>2.4
That was a great effect ####<pos><score>1.2
There was a lot of cheap child humour ####<neg><score>-0.8
Which everyone can relate to ####<pos><score>1.2
This movie is adorable ####<pos><score>2.2
There were some really good things about this movie ####<pos><score>2.0
This movie is just too adorable ####<pos><score>2.4
The visuals were great ####<pos><score>1.8
The voice acting excellent ####<pos><score>2.8
Toy story had elements of it but this movie played with 3d and um different ways to come at you out of the screen ####<pos><score>2.2
This was probably the best 3d movie ive seen in a long time coz it actually used 3d ####<pos><score>2.8
The voice acting in this was incredible ####<pos><score>2.6
So i liked that a lot ####<pos><score>2.2
Of i couldnt i couldnt even believe it was russell brand ####<pos><score>0.8
Steve carell voices gru and russell brand actually really impressed me with his old man voice for the doctor ####<pos><score>1.8
And there was maybe one time when i thought i actually heard russell brand himself ####<neg><score>-0.25
I kept i was listening bored ####<pos><score>0.2
As for 3d i say yes ####<pos><score>1.0
But otherwise i thought he was excellent ####<pos><score>1.8
And some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks ####<pos><score>0.5
Theres one scene in this movie that makes 3d entirely worth it ####<pos><score>2.4
I mean my stomach was almost going wohu as we went down the big drop ####<pos><score>0.6
But theres a roller coaster scene and if you are um get a little bit motion sick you might not wanna see it in 3d because youll feel like youre on this coaster ####<pos><score>0.6
And you dont exactly know whats going on ####<neg><score>-1.0
And i think early on the twist is revealed ####<neg><score>-0.6
And you dont exactly know what is going on ####<neg><score>-0.8
I think it takes place sometime um its i dont think its present day ####<neu><score>0.0
But its um its someone modern i would say ####<pos><score>0.4
Its not its not like a period piece or anything ####<pos><score>0.2
Watch this fucking movie ####<neg><score>-0.5
I think a lot of people are really split about this movie ####<neg><score>-0.4
And um particularly the movies that i feel like shouldve gotten nominated but didnt and never let me go is actually one of those movies ####<pos><score>1.6
It was a pretty slow movie for the most part ####<neg><score>-1.8
Theres a certain deadpan nature to it ####<neg><score>-0.8
But there are you know therere critics of movies that are sometimes too thoughful in a way and i think that would never let me go ####<neg><score>-0.8
And it was it was thoughful ####<pos><score>1.0
Um in a way a lot of the themes in never let me go which were very profound and deep ####<pos><score>1.6
A lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to um explore the themes in the film and you know tightly so i guess which ####<neg><score>-1.8
And i think that the movie did rely on you to kind of figure it out and kind of deal with those ideas by yourself ####<neu><score>0.0
They werent fully explored ####<neg><score>-1.2
Those three are some of the best young actors of today ####<pos><score>2.6
But regardless i thought it was a very good movie ####<pos><score>2.2
And keira knightley i mean everybody knows her from the pirates of the carribean ####<neg><score>-0.4
She and everything she does she has so much grace to it and so much fluidity ####<pos><score>2.0
And andrew garfield of course everybody knows him form the social network ####<neu><score>0.0
But i mean in her other works like pride and prejudice shes just been realy fantastic ####<pos><score>2.6
But anyways they did um they did act very well ####<pos><score>1.4
So look out for that that should be interesting ####<pos><score>1.2
And children will like the movie ####<pos><score>1.6
Parents will find themselves laughing as they reminisce they childhood ####<pos><score>1.6
Since the smurfs are so adorable and they go on thrilling adventures ####<pos><score>2.0
At first i thought the movie would appeal more to younger audience ####<neg><score>-0.2
I think the movie really depicted the liveliness of new york city while since im a new yorker myself ####<pos><score>2.0
But i actually found myself enjoying the movie and laughing ####<pos><score>1.8
The movie also delivers many meaningful messages ####<pos><score>2.0
I also liked how the storyline of the movie worked together smoothly ####<pos><score>2.0
Theyre so hilarious and similar to xxx person with that ####<pos><score>2.0
I also thought some parts of the movie were funny for example um gargamels cat facial expressions ####<pos><score>1.8
It is a fun family film ####<pos><score>1.8
I recommend this film to children six and up ####<pos><score>2.2
I was kind of upset about that ####<neg><score>-1.0
Theres a giant ass twist to this movie at the end ####<pos><score>1.6
Like its obviosly not like a serious fucking movie or anything ####<neg><score>-1.0
Its comedy romantic romcom raoa ####<pos><score>0.2
And she didnt really act like me at all ####<neg><score>-0.5
And i was kind of upset about it ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because like she mustve been an animal and she wasnt ####<neg><score>-0.5
And i was thinkin like if i can be mother fucking emma stone and chris can be royan gosling and that would be just great didnt really happen in the movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Im a little disappointed in myself for not realising the twist before it actually twisted ####<neg><score>-1.0
Because like what the fuck like thats what im good at ####<neg><score>-1.25
Or what i would like to call rayan gosling leather shoe and suit porn ####<neg><score>-0.8
So theres not gonna be any of bad shit ####<pos><score>0.8
But i actually really fucking love this movie ####<pos><score>2.8
I think that that they personally thought that rachel withers really fucking love suits and ryan gosling so they made this movie with me in mind ####<pos><score>0.8
So anyway the movie was really fucking awesome ####<pos><score>3.0
I wish i was ryan gosling ####<pos><score>1.6
No really like rachel whiters needs some fucking fat material ####<neg><score>-2.2
Im not gonna fucking spoil anything for you just because that would be rude ####<neg><score>-1.2
Ryan gosling the best part in the movie ####<pos><score>1.0
Best part of the fucking ass movie was this one scene where ryan gosling was just standing there in a fucking suit eating pizza in slow ass motion ####<pos><score>1.2
And you should all go out and see it and you know stuff ####<pos><score>1.6
Emma stone was in this movie as well and you wouldnt really know it coz she was hardly in it ####<neg><score>-1.6
That was just like hu like zooming in on him and im just like sitting here like any mother fuckers drop ####<neg><score>-0.8
Coz you know apparently according to people on the internet aka tumbler because everyone on tumbler is on crack they all think i look like her or like sound like her or act like her ####<neg><score>-0.75
And i was really upset about it ####<neg><score>-2.2
Like i kind of sound like i might have a penis ####<neg><score>-0.5
I dont know i guess we both have like that like mm male sounding voice ####<neu><score>0.0
We both like flooged in shit ####<neg><score>-0.25
And yeah i know we both have that like an easy way ####<pos><score>0.2
I knew that inception that they were gonna be dreaming ####<neu><score>0.0
Im gonna spoil skins right now i totally knew manny and rick were gonna be related i fucking knew it like i knew it ####<neg><score>-0.5
Really good soundtrack ####<neu><score>0.0
But it was a realy good movie ####<pos><score>2.4
These two developments together caused what was up to that point a noble effort to start falling apart at the seams ####<neg><score>-1.6
And it was painful to watch ####<neg><score>-2.6
I dont even know why i really should begin with listing off the negatives but im going to start with a few of the superficial things ####<neg><score>-2.4
The acting ranges from mediocrity to hamfisted from the live action actors ####<neg><score>-1.6
And um i thought it worked worked pretty well ####<pos><score>1.6
Um and in fact in spite of all the negatives im about to mention i thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third um but at the end of act one two significant things happened ####<neg><score>-0.8
Hactor hummand arrives and starts chewing scenery like its a two dollar steak ####<neg><score>-1.6
And how jordan flies off to the green lantern core planet oh and the movie starts sequel baiting ####<neg><score>-1.0
But i cant really blame them for that ####<neg><score>-0.2
This is star wars prequal territory ####<neg><score>-0.4
I cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequatly without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie ####<neg><score>-0.75
And put them in a justice leage movie with the ritual batman and superman ####<pos><score>0.25
It was widely believed that a sucess of green lantern movie would lead warner brothers to adapt the flash and wonder woman among possibly others ####<pos><score>0.8
It had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that others stuff ####<neg><score>-0.2
So not only that this movie have to deal with the burden of telling its own selfcontained story and setting up its own inevitable sequels ####<neg><score>-0.4
To all the green lantern fans out there i am so sorry ####<neg><score>-2.0
Yeah not good ####<neg><score>-2.0
And warner brothers is never gonna give you one ####<neg><score>-1.0
I say that for two reasons first because someone owes you an appologie ####<neg><score>-1.0
Before i get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives ####<pos><score>0.4
And secondly because as a marvell geek i have experienced my fair share of disappointments over the last decade and i can genuinly symphatize with you ####<neg><score>-0.75
They do a great job with their roles ####<pos><score>2.0
I love jeffrey rush and michael clarke duncan as the voice actors ####<pos><score>1.4
I also love the casting of mark strong as sinestro ####<pos><score>2.0
They are great additions ####<pos><score>1.6
And um finally a particular stand out scene for me was the fighter jet sequence ####<pos><score>1.4
Hes perfect for that role ####<pos><score>2.2
I thought it was really well put together ####<pos><score>2.4
It was by far my favorite action seen in the movie ####<pos><score>2.2
But still its that kind of movie making ####<neg><score>-0.4
The acting is not that bad ####<neg><score>-0.8
But um yeah go check it out ####<pos><score>1.4
Its one its one to check out in theaters i would say ####<pos><score>1.2
Um snif but yeah so the green hornet it was ok ####<pos><score>1.0
I expected a little bit more seriousness ####<neg><score>-1.0
Youll have fun ####<neu><score>0.0
And youll laugh ####<pos><score>1.2
It is funny its a funny movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Lots of lots of laugh out loud moment i guess you could say ####<pos><score>1.6
But it was still good ####<pos><score>1.2
It get it gets pretty serious ####<pos><score>0.2
And it was actually pretty good ####<pos><score>2.0
He was the same old goofy seth rogan that we all know ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um i was expecting seth rogan to be a little bit more serious in this movie but he wasnt ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um i think that i mean i had fun with it ####<pos><score>1.4
Um but it was still a good film ####<pos><score>1.4
And um because of that i was expecting seth rogan to maybe try to be a little bit more serious but he wasnt ####<neg><score>-0.8
So to me thats a pretty good movie ####<pos><score>1.4
Um i still had fun with it ####<pos><score>1.4
But you know thats ok i guess ####<pos><score>0.4
And all the action scenes were great ####<pos><score>2.0
Um the car the black beauty that was amazing all the guns even the car over there that was really sweet ####<pos><score>2.8
Um he was good ####<pos><score>1.4
The special effects were great and the guy who played kato whose first name is j ####<pos><score>1.6
And he did a great job ####<pos><score>2.0
He played kato perfectly ####<pos><score>2.0
And the action was good ####<pos><score>1.6
Um the acting was was pretty good ####<pos><score>1.2
Coz take a bunch of your friends because you you guys will have a good time ####<pos><score>1.6
Um i would definatelly recommend you go see it in theaters ####<pos><score>2.2
Too pretty intense at the end ####<pos><score>1.0
And um fun at the end ####<pos><score>1.2
He is perfect from start to finsih ####<pos><score>2.4
Harisson ford is a long for the ride and having a blast as the second lead ####<pos><score>1.0
And the cast is pretty well rounded out with suppordting performance from guys like sam rockwell as the doc ####<pos><score>1.6
Theyre all playing cliched stock western characters ####<neg><score>-0.4
And the same thing has more or less happened here yeah thats right ####<neg><score>-0.4
The movie called cowboys and aliens daniel craig steels the whole damn show ####<pos><score>2.4
Hes playing a variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by clint eastwood ####<pos><score>0.5
And now that ive seen him in the role i cant imagine any other current actor trying ot pull it off ####<pos><score>1.4
But i really dont care that the characters are walking cliches when they are this well done ####<pos><score>1.6
And the actors do such a good job of carrying of their particular arcs ####<pos><score>2.0
Cowboys and aliens metaphoricaly speaking is like one of those nfl teams that has the talent to be a super bowl champion but instead ends up being a wild cart team that just gets dismissed in the first round of playoffs ####<neg><score>-1.0
I mean it wasnt a bad year ####<neg><score>-0.4
Yeah job pretty well done ####<pos><score>0.8
And that describes cowboys and aliens pretty well ####<neu><score>0.0
But there was a lot of potential left on the table ####<neu><score>0.0
Because given all the strikes that it had going against before wonder production it could have been much much worse ####<pos><score>0.2
Though i guess i should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did ####<pos><score>1.4
But this probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising bad expectations to unreasonable levels ####<neg><score>-1.2
Fortunally some good decisions were made before the camara started rolling ####<pos><score>1.75
The final product ultimately doesnt live up to the high order of that first trailer ####<neg><score>-1.6
When i saw the first trailer back in november of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must see movies for 2011 ####<pos><score>2.4
But if thats all youre looking for youll actually miss the best thing about this movie ####<pos><score>0.6
But its still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens yeah youll pretty much get your fill ####<pos><score>1.2
I mean yeah hes a competent action director ####<neg><score>-0.6
Jon favreau is probably not the guy that i would hire if i was looking for a director for an action movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
But its action isnt particulary memorable ####<neg><score>-1.6
Hes action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow slope that we see in a typical michael bay movie ####<neu><score>0.0
The ironman films are fondly remembered mostly for robert doweny jr not the action ####<pos><score>0.2
And the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any on those movies ####<neg><score>-1.4
Six different people got writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect ####<neg><score>-0.4
Cowboys and aliens problem is the screenplay ####<neg><score>-2.0
The writing isnt as good as the first ####<neg><score>-1.6
The storyline isnt this good ####<neg><score>-2.0
But if you dont expect a lot i think youll enjoy it ####<pos><score>1.0
Snap most of the critics are right ####<neg><score>-1.75
But if you loved the series and you also liked xxx the first movie than youre still gonna have fun ####<pos><score>1.6
It just really heh ####<neg><score>-1.0
If your pet pees carrie wore those horrendous hideous hats they were not catching the ball ####<neg><score>-1.8
Just go in with low expectaions ####<neg><score>-1.2
A few times i thought that was bumped way over the top ####<neg><score>-1.0
And a few times i didnt like the fashion ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um but you know the premise is ok ####<pos><score>0.4
And they kind of looked like clowns the desert scene was one of them ####<neg><score>-1.2
The movie is really too long ####<neg><score>-0.8
And there are a few nice moments ####<pos><score>1.0
Its not even necessary for the plot ####<neg><score>-1.6
They shouldve just cut the wedding in the beginning ####<neg><score>-1.4
But also not necessary ####<neg><score>-1.0
I also thought that desert riding the camels all troup stopped looking like clowns ####<neg><score>-0.2
And um it was just fun to see your old friends again ####<pos><score>1.4
But i love the moment with charlotte in the closet because who hasnt experienced that ####<pos><score>2.2
But dont expect much ####<neg><score>-1.8
So if your a fan id do it ####<pos><score>0.8
And its just like or why do we need these things ####<neg><score>-1.4
It doesnt make any sense ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because when the old flynn finds these things whatever they are theyre so wise and naive kinda like navi now that i think about it ####<pos><score>0.8
Clue which is the program that he created in the first movie kinda pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turns into a crazy jealous psycho stalker bitch ####<neu><score>0.0
But then sam flynn meets his father and tron basically turns into a star wars prequel after that one ####<neg><score>-1.4
Disconnection then that happens at that point ####<neg><score>-0.8
The writers just pull this out of their ass ####<neg><score>-2.2
And the whole movie becomes about these crazy i i isos ####<neg><score>-2.0
And clue has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever cause what is a what is clue ####<neg><score>-2.0
For some kind of freaky teleportation ####<neu><score>0.0
Im a big fan of the first tron ####<pos><score>1.4
Because um in at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers can do every every anything ####<pos><score>0.4
Um i thought this is the perfect time to have a tron sequel ####<pos><score>2.2
Because it kinda controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a tron sequel ####<pos><score>1.4
And everything and now technology actually does anything and everything ####<pos><score>0.25
Lip smacking but i will say that the first third of this movie is amazing ####<pos><score>2.6
Unfortunately um the writers and i were not exactly on the same wavelength ####<neg><score>-1.8
But you know the pacing is so good ####<pos><score>2.0
Its the best summer movie ive seen all year ####<pos><score>2.4
You have lots of uh references to the first movie ####<pos><score>0.2
It gets straight into the story ####<pos><score>1.0
And once sam flynn enters the grid you know the soundtrack draws you in ####<pos><score>1.4
You have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones ####<pos><score>0.666666666667
Uh they dont waste a lot of time on exposition ####<neg><score>-0.4
The special effects look amazing ####<pos><score>2.6
And let me tell you the games look great ####<pos><score>2.4
Because the minute the soundplane enters the grid he is put in the games ####<pos><score>0.25
Um the cho the choreography of the fights the special effects i was so happy to be back in the grid that i wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going ####<pos><score>1.8
All those action sequences in involving the games were great to watch ####<pos><score>2.0
And its like youre a computer program okay if you want to take over the world using real people its the worst way you could possibly do that infiltrate some computer system somewhere and detonate some nukes or something ####<neg><score>-2.0
She displays the emotional distress of her character so well ####<pos><score>1.6
You actually feel for her character ####<pos><score>1.8
You know shes going through the stress and you feel sorry for her and you wanna help her ####<pos><score>1.0
Olso this is one of the best performances ive ever seen out of hers ####<pos><score>2.8
Ive not seen one bad movie that shes been into ####<pos><score>1.6
Teriffic in that ####<neg><score>-1.0
But mary elizabeth winstead i must say she is a teriffic and beautiful and talented acress ####<pos><score>2.4
I was very impressed with his work on the first one ####<pos><score>1.6
But the second one it didnt in some ways take to the next level ####<pos><score>0.4
I thought the first one was creative and inventive and really brought something new to the cinema ####<pos><score>2.0
So it was just about equal to the first one ####<neg><score>-0.2
But in some ways the first one was better ####<neg><score>-1.0
Now um but some of the brush plot that you mey think i hated this movie but youre wrong actually i did ####<pos><score>1.2
Now um but some of the brush plot that you mey think i hated this movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
First im gonna get into the acting which was much much better than the second one ####<pos><score>2.2
I really liked it ####<pos><score>0.8
I did like the second one ####<pos><score>0.6
The second one had wooden acting in some places im sorry ####<neg><score>-1.8
But the rest of the actors were so wooden ####<neg><score>-1.4
But there most of the actors we so witty exeption may be the police cop and kim kimberly ####<pos><score>0.4
I dont know they do seem they need to learn acting better ####<neg><score>-1.2
They were just theyre just they just why acting what theyre doing anyway ####<neg><score>-1.8
Anyway mary elizabeth winstead oh my god she is a teriffic ####<pos><score>2.0
Anyway the further i went acting was much much better in the second one ####<pos><score>1.8
But she is also a teriffic actress ####<pos><score>2.2
Shes nice looking as well ####<neu><score>0.0
It was pretty much just and excuse to put traps in the movie because it was literally completely irrelevant ####<neg><score>-2.2
Like i said i loved the hoffmans storyline ####<pos><score>2.2
But the end was really you you know ####<neg><score>-1.0
But i thought the best part of saw 5 was the storyline like in general ####<pos><score>1.8
The ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual ####<neg><score>-0.8
It was not a real huge saw twist moment ####<neg><score>-0.6
But luckily hoffmans story um was a really really really awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
And um it totally made up for that so thats ok ####<pos><score>1.2
And i guess thats sort of true ####<pos><score>0.4
Because i sure didnt see the end coming ####<neu><score>0.0
So you know i guess it balances out ####<pos><score>0.2
Um so you know that was a little surprising i guess ####<pos><score>0.4
Thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was ####<pos><score>1.4
But ill smack them in the face for the other irrelevant plotline ####<neg><score>-2.6
And dont know what the hell they were thinking ####<neg><score>-2.2
Because im still excited about it ####<pos><score>1.8
Ok all of you knew that obviously ####<neu><score>0.0
As some of you might not notice i was extremly excited about saw 5 ####<pos><score>2.0
And excited to see it ####<pos><score>1.6
So i was you know really hyped up ####<pos><score>1.8
Not exectly what i was expecting ####<pos><score>0.6
And i have to say that it was definately better than the saw 4 ####<pos><score>1.6
And um its just made me really really excided for saw 6 ####<pos><score>2.4
But it was still really really really good ####<pos><score>2.2
So congratulations to the writers for that ####<pos><score>2.0
And it fit very well into the saw series in my opinion ####<pos><score>1.8
And the other one was completely irrelevant as far as i can tell ####<neg><score>-1.8
One of them was great ####<pos><score>1.0
And the irrelevant plot was with five rendom strangers ####<neg><score>-1.2
The great plot was with hoffman tying up all loose ends and stuff ####<pos><score>2.2
But i totally missed how it tied it to the movie at all ####<neg><score>-0.8
Kind of like in saw 2 ####<neu><score>0.0
So that was really bizzare and i didnt care about the characters at all ####<neg><score>-2.6
And im pretty sure thats because it didnt tie in to the movie at all ####<neg><score>-1.6
So it was just really really strange ####<neg><score>-0.8
Because they werent you know introduced well really ####<neg><score>-1.2
Which is still good ####<pos><score>1.4
But it was not exectly what i was expecting and se seriously everything leading up to the end was better than the ending ####<neg><score>-1.0
But like i said the plot of hoffman and everything that was really really awesome ####<pos><score>2.6
And it didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it over or anything its just open ####<neg><score>-1.5
But man oh man it really left the door open ####<pos><score>0.8
And it pretty much just left the door wide open for saw 6 ####<pos><score>0.2
Saw 5 has left like no closure at all at the end of the movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
Because the movie is good ####<pos><score>2.0
Hah so everyone like everyone in cinema was kind like me ####<pos><score>0.8
Because everytime that was like a jump everyone jumped ####<pos><score>0.8
You could feel the jump in ####<pos><score>1.0
And everyone was laughing afterwards ####<pos><score>1.0
And i would go to the cinema again to see it ####<pos><score>1.2
Because that atmosphere like everyone just screeams ####<pos><score>0.4
And just and its just its so funny ####<pos><score>0.8
Um something like what i do like if i jump a lot ####<pos><score>1.75
I think thats how they cope with getting jum like scared and jump and stuff ####<pos><score>0.4
From there it does get a bit like huh not as real as what has been going on ####<neg><score>-1.0
And it is jumpy for people who dont like getting scared or jumpy or anything ####<neg><score>-1.0
And like i do jump ####<pos><score>0.4
But for someone like me who loves horror movies ####<pos><score>0.6
So i think im like immune to them ####<neg><score>-0.6
But i dont exactly get scared ####<neg><score>-0.8
I just thats freaky as hell yeha ####<pos><score>0.5
And the only he mo film that im really scared about is small soldiers ####<neg><score>-0.4
Like it cracked on streight away with what the hell is going on ####<neg><score>-1.0
But insidious um star really good ####<pos><score>0.8
And some of the acting is a little bit like oh my god you wouldnt really do that ####<neg><score>-1.2
Like it dosnt just like and i was at um theres a problem theres a story like adn its like streight away fun storyline started ####<pos><score>0.2
But its just sometimes its just a little bit like oh god they realy shouldnt have done that cringe ####<neg><score>-0.6
But thats like old movies its just like i wouldnt say bad casting ####<neg><score>-1.4
Like really jumped me my friend ####<neg><score>-0.75
Um but really good ####<pos><score>1.6
But it really surprised as i said what you wanna go home ####<neg><score>-0.8
And she wanted to go home and thats like seeing a lot for her coz she likes horror movies as much as i do ####<neg><score>-1.2
I jumped hell of a lot times ####<pos><score>1.4
Huh but i am it was jumpy ####<neg><score>-0.5
Because there is people that wanna go and see it havent seen it yet and might see this video ####<pos><score>0.2
Its kind of like quite fake like i just i couldnt believe it i was like what what are you doing ####<neg><score>-2.25
But overall i enjoyed it ####<pos><score>1.6
Whoever wrote this isnt the writer definatelly ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um and the movie was pretty short ####<neg><score>-0.6
The the whole movie i was you know thinking this isn as bad as ive heard and it wasnt ####<pos><score>1.2
Other than that um i think it was and ok movie ####<pos><score>0.8
And the dialogue threw me off ####<neg><score>-1.0
I dont think its as bad as you probably read on reviews ####<pos><score>0.2
Definatelly a little bit above average ####<pos><score>1.2
So yeah go see it ####<pos><score>1.4
I mean it starts out really slow ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was a cool movie ####<pos><score>1.4
But overall um go see it ####<pos><score>0.8
Um i thought they casted kind of well ####<pos><score>1.0
The acting was allright ####<pos><score>0.2
Oh my god the whole movie had a really dry dialogue ####<neg><score>-1.6
But what really threw me off was the dialogue very cheezy dialogue ####<neg><score>-2.4
But i dont think the humour redeemed the movie from being so bad in the dialogue department ####<neg><score>-1.8
There were a couple funny parts ####<pos><score>0.4
Um it has it has a very predictable story ####<neg><score>-1.4
And again it does really tug at the heart strenghts with the little baby animals at the beginning ####<pos><score>1.4
But if it was anne hathaway who did the singing she did a great job ####<pos><score>2.4
That so what is still a really great movie to take your whole family to ####<pos><score>1.8
Anyway um i would recommend it if if youre like me and you dont normally go to see animated movies ####<pos><score>1.2
I had no idea that anne hathaway could really sing ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um but there really hasnt been much to has come out this year so far that im dying to go see ####<neg><score>-0.2
And im im not really in a big hurry at my age to go see animated movies ####<neg><score>-0.2
And i was thoroughly um surprised ####<pos><score>0.6
And we really wanted to get out of the house um last night ####<neu><score>0.0
At how much i really did enjoy it ####<pos><score>2.0
Anywayit was a really cute movie ####<pos><score>2.0
I really didnt wanna go see it ####<neg><score>-1.4
I did not think i was gonna like it ####<neu><score>0.0
And i was pleasantly surprised by this movie ####<pos><score>1.8
And it seems to me than when production companies start pushing movies that far ahead and when they were gonna be released that usaually means that they are not gonna be great ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um this is a great family movie to take your whole family to this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
I was i thoroughly enjoyed it ####<pos><score>2.4
Um i thought the story line was really cute ####<pos><score>2.0
Its great for all ages ####<pos><score>2.2
So i would recommend this movie ####<pos><score>1.4
Um but they also did a great job in building the backstory of jane foster played by natalie portman and her crew and how they relate to thor ####<pos><score>2.0
So i think that was really good ####<pos><score>1.8
They didnt belabored thor on earth ####<pos><score>0.25
He sounded like he didnt learn from the earthlings ####<neg><score>-0.4
Or why why are they here ####<neu><score>0.0
You have to establsih that fairly quickly ####<neu><score>0.0
And i think that directors of thor and the script writers did that right away ####<pos><score>0.6
You saw thor for how hes in the comics pompous an arogant individual ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um so that makes sense ####<neu><score>0.0
You get other whole shield involvement which is cool to see that a lot of cooler references that at one point they reference im a doctor with gama radiation ####<pos><score>2.4
I would put money on it that it is going to be the blockbuster hit of the summer in terms of when you look at all the movies ####<pos><score>2.6
I think that would do very well ####<pos><score>1.2
I im a cap guy captain america fan ####<pos><score>1.0
I think its gonna catapult chris hemsworth to be even a bigger star ####<pos><score>1.6
Um so i think thor is really gonna do well ####<pos><score>1.0
Charlie sheen was winning there ####<pos><score>1.6
Um great 80s movie for those who havent seen it ####<pos><score>2.8
So they could um um kind of get a little bit of chris hemsworth star power into that ####<pos><score>0.8
And hes winning no ####<pos><score>0.5
They did very well to establish the character of thor ####<pos><score>1.6
Um great movie overall ####<pos><score>2.2
And you saw this with the nbc recent flop of the cape which is a show i love ####<neg><score>-0.2
The problem with a lot of comic book shows and movies ####<neg><score>-1.2
And they needed character established right away ####<neg><score>-1.4
But the audience that was watching it they needed they needed a pay off right away ####<neg><score>-0.2
And why is this person wearing tights ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um what you get in the sitcoms in terms of comic books and kind of the movies that take so loud to build that ####<neu><score>0.0
You know why what is their mission ####<neg><score>-0.4
Or why are they carrying a hammer ####<neg><score>-0.666666666667
Its sexy but not slutty ####<pos><score>1.4
That the dancers um wonderful ####<pos><score>2.2
Um the songs in the movie are wonderful ####<pos><score>1.6
Who is drop dead gorgeous by the way ####<pos><score>1.4
And overall probably id give it about 35 stars you know popcorn movie and you know ####<pos><score>0.8
You know it matches the whole theme of the movie you know cabaret and you know the looks ####<pos><score>1.0
This one you know probably in the middle so 35 stars ####<neg><score>-0.2
Considering all the awesome movies that we had and xxx inception the black swan and you know the social network ####<pos><score>0.2
And if you have money to spend go ahead ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um first things first christina aguileras xxx i swear the xxx xxx ####<pos><score>1.5
And she sure can sing really really well in this movie you know ####<pos><score>2.0
Um why i said that is because she is god a crazy crazy voice ####<pos><score>0.75
But she still looks like shes 48 ####<neg><score>-1.6
And you know it makes you wanna know who else you know in the history of nowadays has the voice like that and you know its noone ####<neg><score>-0.4
Coz when you see her face moves it feels like you know you feel worried for her ####<pos><score>0.75
And her face doesnt move at all ####<neg><score>-1.4
And overall the movies quite entertaining ####<pos><score>1.6
You feel like her face is going to fall apart ####<neg><score>-1.2
But im really really really glad i saw it ####<pos><score>1.6
And i would recommend it to other people its true ####<pos><score>1.8
Even though i was like hu im gonna hate it ####<neg><score>-0.5
But im just gonna have to say it ####<neu><score>0.0
But yeah generally the accents were really really good ####<pos><score>2.6
So good one you america for doing that ####<pos><score>1.4
I doubt that theyre gonna do this for all the screenings because it was the premiere ####<pos><score>0.4
I would not have chosen to go and see that ####<neu><score>0.0
Its my favorite film ever ####<pos><score>2.0
Um its not my favorite film ever ####<neg><score>-0.4
It was amazing ####<pos><score>2.8
And i actually liked the film a lot ####<pos><score>2.2
The premiere itself was really cool ####<pos><score>1.8
Because i thought how the hell is dickens and disney gonna work together like this ####<neg><score>-1.0
And i wasnt expecting to ####<pos><score>0.2
And the end part is really really funny ####<pos><score>2.4
But i thought they actually worked pretty well ####<pos><score>2.0
Hes like what a delightful child ####<pos><score>1.4
Because hes been such a grumpy character and hes really scared and in the end hes so changed and hes really funny ####<pos><score>1.4
The animation was amazing ####<pos><score>2.8
And its all kind of its hard to explain ####<pos><score>0.25
Because sometimes 3d isnt really that good ####<neg><score>-1.0
I wasnt expecting that much ####<neg><score>-0.4
You kind of forget about the fact that it is 3d ####<pos><score>1.0
But it was fenomenal ####<pos><score>2.6
That was one of my other concerns ####<neg><score>-0.8
The voices are really good ####<pos><score>2.2
But than its so obviously not an english character ####<neg><score>-0.2
Was that as an english person i get really annoyed when american shows and films have an english character ####<neg><score>-1.8
I can imagine getting this on dvd and watching it at christmas at time because it makes you feel so like huh its not about commercialization its about you know families being together ####<pos><score>2.4
But i would definately watch it again ####<pos><score>2.0
Which were um a disasterous ####<neg><score>-1.6
But i just wanted to put this up soon ####<pos><score>0.4
And ill tell you all about like the cool premiere and stuff ####<pos><score>0.8
Theres not like a really good twist ####<neg><score>-2.0
Its a good action movie ####<pos><score>1.8
Its like 90 bourne identity meets 10 willy wonka ####<neg><score>-0.6
Theres some really strange characters in this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because i went into the movie thinking theres no way ####<neg><score>-1.25
And so they kind of explain it a little bit but not really ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um i i at the end of the movie the friends i was with uh one of them goes was there a plot to this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
It doesnt have a deep seeded plot ####<neg><score>-2.0
It was it did add to the movie though it ####<pos><score>1.4
And it visually its kinda cool how they show her confusion because she grows up in the woods ####<pos><score>1.8
And i was pretty open to to it being good ####<pos><score>0.6
I was like theres no way that theyre gonna be able to convince me that a sixteen year old girl can take down like six adult dudes ####<neg><score>-1.6
I at first when i saw the previews i thought it was gonna be stupid to be perfectly honest ####<neg><score>-0.8
And they both liked it ####<pos><score>1.4
So i saw some other reviews and i was like okay i was surprised ####<pos><score>0.4
And i gotta say i wasnt blown away by it ####<neg><score>-1.4
They s and all the people walking out of the theatre and beyond the trailer really liked it ####<pos><score>1.6
It was good ####<pos><score>1.6
I didnt think it was great or epic or just fantastic ####<neg><score>-0.2
Which is cool ####<pos><score>1.2
The music kinda drove a lot of the action ####<pos><score>0.2
It was it was an it was an okay movie ####<pos><score>0.6
I mean i dont regret seeing it ####<pos><score>1.2
Anyways skipping past that shes got this like kick a attitude ####<pos><score>0.4
Eric bana decides to train to be this most paranoid asassin chick in the world ####<neg><score>-0.6
Its good ####<pos><score>0.6
So its it kind of feels like a sundance film festival type of movie ####<neg><score>-0.4
Its not polished quite as much as i would like it to be ####<neg><score>-1.0
But its not great ####<neg><score>-1.0
Like they convinced me like this chick could probably take that dude down which is pretty hard ####<pos><score>1.0
It is good though ####<pos><score>1.8
It was original ####<pos><score>1.6
So it it was and interesting movie ####<pos><score>1.6
I did like kind of like the action ####<pos><score>1.0
It wasnt the it wasnt the usual ####<neg><score>-1.2
But it was it was interesting ####<pos><score>1.8
Um it wasnt bad ####<pos><score>0.8
The soundtrack was interesting ####<pos><score>1.2
And i liked it ####<pos><score>1.5
That you respect that joe wright tried to do something completely different here ####<pos><score>1.2
But i think its one of those movies thats so unique ####<pos><score>2.2
Its in your face ####<pos><score>0.25
Its colorful ####<pos><score>1.6
And i think um what i took away from this was that really tried very hard to make something original ####<pos><score>1.8
Its really non stop from beginning to end ####<pos><score>1.4
And something that i cant find anything else to compare it to ####<pos><score>1.33333333333
This is his most engaging endevour yet ####<pos><score>2.4
He takes great actors or acresses in this case like saoirse ronan and cate blanchett ####<pos><score>1.4
And he what he does with hanna is he makes the movie on like anything weve seen before ####<pos><score>1.2
Um what really need about this movie is the chamical brothers did the soundtracks whats pulse pounding the entire way through ####<pos><score>1.4
And he puts them in very strange and unusual characters ####<neu><score>0.0
Theres all these colorful characters ####<pos><score>2.0
You never know whats gonna happen ####<pos><score>0.6
I gave it a b ####<pos><score>1.4
Now it isnt a great fantastic tell everybody about that kind of movie ####<neu><score>0.0
So easy on the eyes ####<pos><score>2.0
Um i think hes my new favorite ####<pos><score>1.2
Yeah so i suggest that you guys all watch this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
I always like to read the book first ####<pos><score>0.5
Because priscilla from the readables gave a such a good review ####<pos><score>0.6
Its a weird thing ####<neg><score>-0.5
It was so good ####<pos><score>2.6
Um i suggest that you guys go and watch this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Um usually im not really a big huge scifi alien kind of fan ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um its surpassed my expectations ####<pos><score>2.4
Um i really wanna go read the book now ####<pos><score>1.8
But um it was really really good ####<pos><score>3.0
I heard that in the book it describes um the plan of the glory a lot better ####<neg><score>-1.0
Coz im so curious to see um how the storyline um got to that point ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um i cant wait until the next one comes out too ####<pos><score>1.8
Um gives more details so i cant wait to get my hands on it now ####<pos><score>1.4
Um he wrote a good book ####<pos><score>1.75
Um it it turns out that james fray who um i realy like ####<pos><score>1.2
Im really excited ####<pos><score>2.0
Um and i cant wait for the next one to come out ####<pos><score>2.4
He was unbelievable ####<pos><score>1.6
Um as for alex xxx i am a new alex fan ####<pos><score>0.8
But um it was in a good taste ####<pos><score>1.8
I was surprised um the amount of skin they showed ####<neg><score>-0.4
He um added a grat dimension to the movie as well ####<pos><score>1.8
Um and i thought woody harelson was a funny ####<pos><score>1.6
But overall i thought it was it was a fun picture ####<pos><score>2.0
Storyline was ok ####<pos><score>0.6
Um certianly again more of a day movie than um seeing it alone ####<pos><score>0.2
I i do think its worth seeing ####<pos><score>1.6
So id go see it ####<pos><score>1.8
Unless you ladies go together to see it together ####<pos><score>0.6
Thumbs up ####<pos><score>1.6
Mila kunis and justin timberlake i thought they made a great duo ####<pos><score>2.4
Theres some great bedroom scenes ####<pos><score>2.2
Mila kunis she is gorgeous ####<pos><score>2.0
A fine light weight day movie ####<pos><score>1.8
You guys are youre gonna get to enjoy ####<pos><score>1.0
Um certainly there are some scenes where i think some of the women are gonna feel more the emotion of it ####<pos><score>0.2
I think some of the women are going to enjoy this more than the guys ####<pos><score>0.4
Great steamy bedroom scenes ####<pos><score>1.0
There are some funny lines ####<pos><score>1.6
I would love that ####<pos><score>1.8
That be that would be cool to see i mean ####<pos><score>0.4
Eventually were gonna get burned out as a soci as a society ####<neg><score>-1.2
Once agian were gonna be burned out on 3d ####<neg><score>-0.8
Coz sometimes 3d can mess up the color at least the old anaglyphic 3d i think real d it you know had sort of had sort of tempted but it winds itself its also um not ideal for for the imigae itslef ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um but this looked amazing looked really good ####<pos><score>2.8
And it makes it worth going to see this movie if youve got um the dolby 3d somewhere in your town ####<pos><score>1.8
And i hope this takes over as the new system ####<pos><score>1.0
Because its it is a gimmick ultmatelly ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um but i will say um with this with this quality of 3d you could almost make you know a regular like a dramatic movie or an action movie or something that was really good movie and you could make it 3d and it wouldnt at all ####<pos><score>1.4
But its actually worth talking about ####<pos><score>1.0
And i actually am not finding the series to be very fun and popcorn kind of movie ####<neu><score>0.0
Because the movie itself is the same old crap from the series ####<neg><score>-2.0
In this case it didnt take much convincing which is a little silly ####<neu><score>0.0
You just cant walk in exopecting anything other than that ####<neg><score>-0.6
The plot is you know ####<neg><score>-0.2
But the acting is bad ####<neg><score>-2.2
I guess for this kind of movie the plot is is is threadbare ####<neg><score>-1.0
Actually the acting is ok ####<pos><score>0.4
But none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway ####<pos><score>1.4
The the um character development is nil ####<neg><score>-2.0
Which is a terrible picture ####<neg><score>-2.4
Its a popcorn movie ####<neg><score>-0.5
I had ideal seats ####<pos><score>1.0
Um but um this 3d definatelly looks a lot better i think that real d ####<pos><score>2.0
Um but the they looked awesome ####<pos><score>1.6
Because its good to sit right in the middle of the theater with 3d ####<pos><score>0.6
Um the color looked great ####<pos><score>2.0
The 3d itself really had improved ####<pos><score>1.2
Number one im getting a little sick of the xxx kind of lead character sort of really awkward boy who is really awkward and stuff you know im getting sick of that character and im tired of it ####<neg><score>-2.8
I have two problems with it ####<neg><score>-1.8
But he might as well ####<pos><score>0.8
And i get angry about it laughter xxx doesnt play best character in the film ####<neg><score>-2.0
Second theres one massive plot hole in this film and it is the size of a dragon that is big as a mountain and when you see the film youll probably know what i mean ####<neg><score>-1.0
So im im im through with that guy ####<neg><score>-1.4
And the only explanation i come up with makes this story kind of kind of creepy ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um theres no explanation for this thing ####<neg><score>-1.6
Other then those two things this is a really fun film that you will enjoy unless you are soleless piece of machenery ####<neg><score>-0.4
I just wanted to let you know that 3d is really ridiculously expensive ####<neg><score>-1.2
You should take your kids ####<pos><score>1.6
You know what you should see how to train your dragon ####<pos><score>1.8
Its probably the best thing currently in theaters ####<pos><score>2.2
And if you dont have kids you may wanna consider seeing it anyway ####<pos><score>1.8
Its a lot of fun to watch ####<pos><score>2.2
It is its a great story ####<pos><score>2.6
And its really well written ####<pos><score>2.0
Its beautifully done ####<pos><score>2.6
They really needed to somehow set them apart with armor ####<neg><score>-1.6
You cant tell which are the good owls which are the bed owls ####<neg><score>-0.6
Or you can see up to you ####<pos><score>0.2
Anyway this is one you can skip ####<neg><score>-1.8
Im gonna give this a grade b minus ####<pos><score>1.2
The flying sequences are beautiful ####<pos><score>2.4
The cgi work the 3d is spectacular ####<pos><score>2.8
And come of real ####<pos><score>0.2
And the owls are really wonderful ####<pos><score>2.2
But the story is very dark ####<neg><score>-1.0
And they do have very nice personalites ####<pos><score>1.6
Um my other complaint other than that theres like nothing light or funny in this story to break up the slumber mood is the battle itself ####<neg><score>-1.8
In fact my six years old was scared most of the movie ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um but hey if youre looking to spend some money um go check it out maybe you will like it ####<neg><score>-1.0
But um from my review im gonna say im gonna give it two thumbs down ####<neg><score>-2.8
Release the cracken on this movie dont go see it go see something else how to train the dragon and um thats all im gonna say about that ####<neg><score>-2.8
So disappointment definately ####<neg><score>-2.0
And my friedns who were there had nothing good to say about it ####<neg><score>-2.4
So unfortunatelly i must say this one is probably gonna be waiting until it comes on hbo ####<neg><score>-1.2
Or get it at um um red box for a buck ####<neg><score>-0.5
Um i just really didnt like it ####<neg><score>-2.0
I did not wanna give this movie a bad review ####<neg><score>-0.2
I im a fan of the original you know loved it ####<pos><score>1.2
Which is a reboot i guess it would be the best term for the i believe it was a 1981 movie clash of the titans ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um i was really looking forward to it ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um unfortunatelly im going to have to say this movie was terrible ####<neg><score>-2.8
Is it gonna be good ####<neg><score>-0.2
I was a little hasitant at firstyou know as you are with with reboots you know ####<neg><score>-0.8
I think that music that music they kind of pull it with the soundtrack really got me excited about seeing this movie ####<pos><score>1.8
But as the trailers came out i i really liked what i was seeing ####<pos><score>1.8
But to me someone needs to release the crackon on this movie and just totally destroy it ####<neg><score>-3.0
And and being a fan of the original i was i was looking forward to seeing it ####<neg><score>-1.0
It seemed like there was no story development in it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Because i just felt like it was it seemed like it was a rushed movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
I felt like medusa really wasnt that scary ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um i just really didnt have good time ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um i just think they made her almost looked too you know they tried that you know make her look too beautiful ####<neg><score>-1.2
Maybe it was coz i was a kid back at that day but medusa was a lot scar scarier then ####<neg><score>-1.0
The screen you know was that i i kind of fo found myself you know wanted to lay my head back and take a nap ####<neg><score>-2.2
But um i just in whole really didnt like this movie ####<neg><score>-2.2
And and after the movie um going out into the theater into the lobby i had noone i heard noone say anything good ####<neg><score>-2.4
And actually the guy sitting next to me actually was taking a nap laughter he kept dozing off ####<neg><score>-1.4
Heard good things about the screenings on that ####<pos><score>1.6
And um but i got to i got to do my duty and let you guys know its a a major suck fest ####<neg><score>-3.0
And um looking really forward to seeing that movie ####<pos><score>1.8
So thats thumbs down if you dont understand ####<neg><score>-2.2
I give it about one and a half stars ####<neg><score>-2.0
But the cgi was great ####<pos><score>1.4
So it is not a buy ####<neg><score>-1.25
Um medusa was way different from percy jackson and glandon laws ####<neg><score>-0.4
And thats exectly how i thought a giant scorpion would look with the piece of driftwood that had blue fire on it ####<neg><score>-0.5
But the best part about the movie i ve got a free pair of glasses ####<neg><score>-1.0
It couldve been better ####<neg><score>-1.0
They couldve made zeus a little less sparkly it was very distracting ####<neg><score>-1.6
The first one was a lot better ####<neg><score>-0.8
The first one made more sense ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um it was very hard to follow ####<neg><score>-2.0
They pretend theres gonna be this big scene it maybe lasts about a minute and i was like is that it ####<neg><score>-1.6
And the crackon you know in the preview is like so much hype ####<neg><score>-1.0
The previews are much more 3d the ne so yeah it was very disappointing ####<neg><score>-1.8
And than its definatelly not a 3d movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
I just get so tired of unpredictable movies ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um yea so anyways its really predictable ####<neg><score>-1.8
I mean you can go see i personally didnt like it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Because i just got really bored with it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um and its really unpredictable ####<neg><score>-0.25
And a guy who looks a lot like tom cruise ####<pos><score>0.2
Uh i personally think its a waste of money ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um lip smacking this movie is dumb ####<neg><score>-2.6
Laughing i just just cant stand movies where its like the same plot as like 50 other million movies ####<neg><score>-2.8
Just because i cant stand movies that are so predictable ####<neg><score>-2.0
I really dont care to see those ####<neg><score>-2.0
Just different just different people playing the roles ####<pos><score>0.4
You know i like kate hudson ####<pos><score>1.2
But you know what i took a chance ####<pos><score>0.2
And dont get me wrong there were you know funny parts in the movie ####<pos><score>0.2
So i thought this movie would be funny ####<pos><score>0.4
I dont care for basically any of it ####<neg><score>-2.2
I just dont care for the plot ####<neg><score>-2.0
Its the same you know rise and fall ####<neg><score>-0.4
Because its predictable ####<neg><score>-1.0
And so shes all sad walking in the rain blah blah blah ####<neg><score>-1.2
But shes in trouble you know cuz she doesnt wanna tell her best friend blah blah blah ####<neg><score>-0.6
Ive been saying that a lot in this video blah blah blah blah ####<neg><score>-1.8
And blah blah blah ####<neg><score>-0.6
Its really like like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles ####<pos><score>0.8
Like the story of swan lake is why people go see swan lake its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience ####<pos><score>1.8
And then you know put in some action or some romance or sex or whatever like to keep people sort of engaged ####<pos><score>0.8
Um and thats what traditionl narrative movies do ####<pos><score>0.4
And this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is ####<neg><score>-1.6
And the characters are they are all just place holders ####<neg><score>-1.6
That was pretty funny and um stupid for movies had this really long like really not really long but like really intense rent a about it ####<pos><score>1.4
I dont think its like the worst movie ive even seen just this year ####<neu><score>0.0
Um and it it is just like everybody saying it is bad ####<neg><score>-2.4
Like i was more entertained by it than battle la which was just a slog and boring and i just try to totally uninteresting ####<pos><score>0.2
But i would say i i enjoyed sucker punch ####<pos><score>1.6
Um it is bad ####<neg><score>-2.2
And sucker punch is a failer but like a really ambitious weird the interesting idiosyncratic failure ####<neg><score>-0.8
Its not bad in the way i was expecting it to be bad ####<neg><score>-0.2
But its not bad i think the way most people have been saying its bad ####<neg><score>-0.2
Like i think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know with drama that we dont get to know anything about these characters their play isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats gonna happen before it happens ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film ####<neu><score>0.0
I think its really much more like a musical ####<pos><score>0.6
Um and and all those things are true but i dont think its trying to be that ####<neg><score>-0.6
But it really has more in common with a musical or and opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film ####<pos><score>0.2
And i know this is gonna sound silly coz its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie ####<pos><score>1.0
So its like puts some people in it and youre gonna enjoy spending time with them ####<pos><score>0.6
Coz like am remains in narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place ####<neg><score>-0.2
Make them compelling in their relationships compelling and then have a story thats like at five minutes this happens and at ten minutes this happens that like moves forward and has momentum ####<neu><score>0.0
Therere some funny dialogue ####<pos><score>1.4
I mean that movie was a waste of time ####<neg><score>-2.6
I mean her acting is like so so and i cant believe she even won a oscar beleive she won an oscar or for best supporting actress or best actress something ####<neg><score>-1.8
And it just really wasnt good ####<neg><score>-2.8
Its two girls trying too hard ####<neg><score>-1.6
What can i say im just curious ####<neu><score>0.0
Yes she has a fat ass in terms of white girls but her ass isnt really that fat ####<neg><score>-1.25
Dont get me wrong kate hudson is is pretty fine looking but i just think its kind of stupid everyone says has a fat ass ####<neg><score>-0.4
I mean the movie really wasnt funny at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
First of all the movie was boring ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean the movie was i guess it was a waste of time ####<neg><score>-1.2
All the all the funny parts werent funny ####<neg><score>-2.0
Anne hathaway is really over rated in my opinion ####<neg><score>-2.2
I wa hey she might like it but even then its not really funny at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
I liked ants ####<neu><score>0.0
I love the shrek films ####<pos><score>2.0
But as far as kung fu panda goes i was hoping for a lot more it just wasnt there for me i dont know ####<neg><score>-1.6
I was a little bit disappointed in the film ####<neg><score>-1.4
It didnt have a whole out of humor going on with it at least none that really made you wanna laugh out loud ####<neg><score>-1.6
But the movie itself was just a little dry ####<neg><score>-1.8
Now im not gonna lie therere a few parts that have great action sequences now even though it is an animated film it did have some great fight scenes ####<pos><score>1.4
Um even the kids and the audience itself just kind of chuckled a little bit gave a few laughs ####<neg><score>-1.0
Everything you see in the trailer itself was pretty much all the humor youre gonna see in the movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um but as far as humor goes not as much as i was expecting ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um maybe better like next time dreamworks but for this one for me it just wasnt what i was hoping it would be ####<neg><score>-2.2
Um um a you know along with the xxx i would probably saying go see this movie an early showing dont spend a lot of money for the night viewing ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um the direction is a bit its wobbly ####<neg><score>-1.2
Its its a bit of a mixed bag coz there were some very bright moments ####<pos><score>0.8
But what it lacks in those areas it most definately makes up for just like sheer visual spectacle ####<pos><score>1.8
Basically a lot of elements that i could take a movie on its really wobbly ####<neg><score>-1.4
So many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of huh thats really really cool ####<pos><score>2.4
I mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movies since probably avatar me if not prettier ####<pos><score>2.6
It it doesnt make much sense i know ####<neg><score>-1.2
And then take that world that have been set like a crap tunnel of really kinetic really well done action sequences in it and you have tron legacy ####<pos><score>2.2
And basically this makes no sense ####<neg><score>-1.8
Main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this like ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences ####<pos><score>0.4
But i do think its a very interesting one ####<pos><score>1.2
And i dont think thats a very good movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
But i was still ridicilously entertained by it ####<pos><score>2.6
I can tell you that tron legacy is not a good movie ####<neg><score>-2.4
Tron legacy is a movie where on most counts that i judge movies it kind of fails ####<neg><score>-1.0
Are these two things possible in the same sentancei i really do think so ####<pos><score>0.8
The script can be horrible ####<neg><score>-2.0
The performances are nah ####<neg><score>-1.4
And some really cool gun fights ####<pos><score>2.0
Um one of the big things i was disappointed though was i felt that they couldve done a lot more with 3d ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um now i dont really recommend this if you go on a date with some girl ####<neg><score>-2.0
And i thought it was just gonna be more than that but so i was a little disappointed in that ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um but if youre xxx movie goer like i am i totally recommend seeing this because its just a fun entertaining movie and i think that you will enjoye it ####<pos><score>2.6
Now this movie is just ridiculous and i i thought it was excellent ####<pos><score>3.0
She didnt really do anything for me ####<neg><score>-1.6
Her acting was pretty bad ####<neg><score>-2.0
And his acting wasnt really good in that movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
But the real star that fell out of this movie was william fichtner character or william fichtner ####<pos><score>1.4
And whatever so no im not saying this movie is bad coz its its not ####<neg><score>-0.8
But it made it hysterical and it was just funny with all of these little one liners that he had ####<pos><score>2.2
It was it was good ####<pos><score>1.8
Like i said before it had tacky one liners that were just hysterical ####<pos><score>1.6
The whole time i saw her all i thought was helen hunt and renee zellwegger ####<neg><score>-0.4
Another thing was the fact that there was not one healthy relationship or positive good relationship in this whole movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
But thats kind of depressing ####<neg><score>-1.4
I dont really know i dont its so weird ####<neg><score>-0.75
And there were times that i thought it was funny ####<pos><score>0.6
I there were times in the movie where i felt really bored ####<neg><score>-1.8
I just dont think it was very good ####<neg><score>-2.2
And there were times that i was just sitting there after they said their jokes and i was like thats not nobodys laughing thats not funny ####<neg><score>-2.2
So i think that no strings attached was better than friends with benefits ####<pos><score>0.8
And this is the thing friends with benefits and no strings attached they are the same movie different ways of getting to the same point but its the same point ####<neg><score>-0.6
I thought it was very funny ####<pos><score>2.0
I was not bored during no strings attached ####<pos><score>0.6
Butsigh it had a lot of really bad moments ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um and uh friends with benefits had its moments ####<neu><score>0.0
He is brilliant there is not a movie that i see him in that i dont end up crying because he is so fantastic and he just breaks your heart whenever he does you know a role that usually his roles do break your heart at some point so definitely did in this movie ####<pos><score>2.8
And he is one of my favorite actors ever ####<pos><score>2.0
The lady who plays justin timberlakes sister um i thought she was very good in this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
I like teared up in friends with benefits because of him ####<pos><score>1.4
And she looks like renee zellwegger and helen hunt from a twister movie ####<neg><score>-0.2
And i thought she was just like really natural and funny ####<pos><score>2.0
It was weird ####<neg><score>-1.0
And she talks like her too ####<pos><score>0.2
Lip smakcing a lot of this movie brings a cute laugh here and there ####<pos><score>1.0
Even though the whole movie is based on whether she gets to dublin in time youre never really worried about it because you know she gets there ####<neg><score>-0.4
And seem to be really enjoying themselves the whole way through ####<pos><score>1.8
And both the actors amy adams and matthew goode work well with each other ####<pos><score>1.4
All in all if youre looking for a cute romantic comedy with a beautiful setting then this will probably be a good movie for you ####<pos><score>2.0
Even when theyre fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike ####<neg><score>-0.8
Which would have been a better name for the movie ####<neg><score>-0.2
The countryside which they showed while going across ireland was astoundingly ble beautiful ####<pos><score>2.0
And i really enjoyed it ####<pos><score>2.2
Although i enjoyed the movie ####<pos><score>1.2
And in the scene with the destroyed castle it really reminded me why i want to go there so badly ####<pos><score>1.4
Its a fun chick flick ####<pos><score>1.6
If i think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great ####<neg><score>-1.2
Lip smacking all the problems that come to stop them from getting to their destination are although plausible a little weak ####<neg><score>-0.8
But other than that it doesnt really hold up under inspection ####<neg><score>-1.6
So zach snyder here is making a movie thats ostensibly about female empow empowerment but its a movie about female empowerment which includes a lot of clearing throat slapping that includes a lot of women in bustiers that includes a lot of violence done against women and ultimately in which most of the women end up completely disempowered ####<neg><score>-2.6
It would be completely inappropriate in fact it would be racist ####<neg><score>-2.2
I could kinda see that in a sort of chris rock dave chapelle way ####<pos><score>1.0
Clapping laughing so okay if zach snyder were a woman i would say okay shes making a comment about the way women cant be empowered in male dominated societies in the way men um distract and and hurt and damage women and prevent them from asserting who they really are ####<neg><score>-0.4
So if i give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt this is a movie that looks great has some bad acting ####<pos><score>0.4
But zach snyder is a guy and because of that this stuff kinda ends up looking like the sh he man woman haters club ####<neg><score>-1.6
If i dont give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt ####<neg><score>-0.6
And has way too much violence against women ####<neg><score>-1.8
Poop ####<neg><score>-2.5
Guardians of owl land whatever that came out and i never saw it ####<neu><score>0.0
Music in background laughing currently in theatres starring no one youve ever heard of ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um heres why yes stuttering t theres problems with this and i wanna talk about them but you know it looks beautiful ####<pos><score>0.4
And this suckers getting this sucker is getting panned like last airbender garbage panned and i wanna say this i did not think it was like last airbender garbage ####<neg><score>-2.6
It actually has some some them thematically it has some cool themes about heroism and about like taking ownership of yourself and things like that which i resonated with and i whi and which i appreciated ####<pos><score>1.8
There are some really cool uh moments in this ####<pos><score>2.0
Um if like me or laughing some other white person or hispanic person or whatever did the same jokes it would not be funny ####<neg><score>-2.0
But heres the essential problem with this movie the essentail problem of this movie well maybe this would be the best way to put it um there was a uh a comedian named dave chapelle um and dave chapelle um and another comedian chris rock are um african american and in their comedy they sometimes take on african american culture what they perceive to be african american culture and so they will essentially make fun of black people and the thing with dave chapelle and with chris rock is because theyre black they can kinda do that and theres something about that thats acceptable ####<neg><score>-1.6
And it wasnt worth it in my opinion to go see it ####<neg><score>-2.4
So that just pissed me off more ####<neg><score>-2.4
And i loved it and this one just was a flat of disappointments ####<neg><score>-2.2
But really i couldve shouldve just walked up and left at that moment ####<neg><score>-2.4
So im gonna rate this one two stars ####<neg><score>-1.8
Because the movie did have some points when i was laughing ####<pos><score>0.4
But very few ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um it was a waste of my time ####<neg><score>-2.8
And i dont suggest anyone go see it ####<neg><score>-2.2
If youre hoping to if you have to have if you have kids and youre forced to go which you probably will if you have kids you know put up with it as a parent ####<neg><score>-1.6
But on your own dont go see it ####<neg><score>-1.8
It couldve been so much better i i couldve i saw it being so much better in my head but it just wasnt ####<neg><score>-2.0
It disappointed me highly ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i was just sort of discouraged after seeing the movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
And im definatelly wish i had my money back ####<neg><score>-3.0
It couldve been so much better ####<neg><score>-1.8
Than the second sequel was really great ####<pos><score>2.2
It was boring ####<neg><score>-2.0
And not at all original in my opinion ####<neg><score>-2.2
Its not really that great ####<neg><score>-2.0
Everyone is split on this one just as they were on spiderman ####<neg><score>-0.4
And the characters just werent the same as the first two that i fell in love with them ####<neg><score>-1.2
It just kind of made me wanna really walk out of the theater ####<neg><score>-2.6
And this is the one that i can say was definatelly disappointed ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i was really hoping that this one be just as good ####<neg><score>-0.8
I love the first shrek and the second shrek ####<pos><score>2.0
I was really disappointed with that ####<neg><score>-2.2
And it just that it hadnt anything new to offer ####<neg><score>-2.2
And it offered nothing of the such ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean i went in there hoping to see something original and funny like the first two ####<neg><score>-1.8
There was a few jokes ok yeah make you giggle or something ####<pos><score>0.6
It wasnt remotly funny ####<neg><score>-0.4
But im gonna give it a two to be fair ####<neg><score>-1.2
But i still find it pointless in the end of the movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean its pleasent to the story ####<neg><score>-0.2
Nothing really that funny ####<neg><score>-1.0
But thats nothing major ####<neg><score>-0.25
The characters are all the same ####<neg><score>-1.6
Or anything original ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i loved puss in boots ####<pos><score>2.0
And not even as good as the first two movies ####<neg><score>-1.2
The donkey and puss in boots rivalry thats going on it just it wasnt as funny the third time around ####<neg><score>-1.8
And he wasnt even that great this time around ####<neg><score>-2.0
Plain and simply it was dull for me ####<neg><score>-2.0
And there was nothing new to offer ####<neg><score>-2.0
I have to agree on the negative side it was not great ####<neg><score>-1.4
And just they are with all the other sequels that are coming out an this one ####<neu><score>0.0
So the addition of this character was pretty pointless ####<neg><score>-1.8
And none of them were really that great i mean stands out in your mind ####<neg><score>-1.4
But they didnt even give him that much to do the he had only few minor lines ####<neg><score>-1.8
And theres a ne an introduction of a new character justine timberlakes character already in the film ####<neg><score>-0.2
I mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny ####<pos><score>0.4
So i definatelly suggest ####<pos><score>0.2
It wasnt even remotely good ####<neg><score>-2.8
It shouldve really be one ####<neg><score>-1.0
Well he plays that well so hes a good villain ####<pos><score>1.4
Its pretty pretty scary looking ####<neg><score>-0.8
He also has some really cool guns so that its like a desert eagle but it has to barrels to it ####<pos><score>2.2
And i who would i mean ####<pos><score>0.5
I wouldnt want that pointed at me ####<neg><score>-0.8
The action they do have is really well done ####<pos><score>1.8
Um like i said i thought the movie was great ####<pos><score>2.2
They did a good job with the fight scenes ####<pos><score>2.0
Um they did a good job with car ####<pos><score>1.6
Um but this movie it had everything humor romance action ####<pos><score>2.6
Of course um it was just it was fun it was a fun entertaining movie ####<pos><score>1.8
Uh it was good for the entire family ####<pos><score>2.0
Um definitely recommend checking seeing this uh checking this movie out ####<pos><score>1.4
Im not even sure what they were ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was just so cool ####<pos><score>2.6
Like a covered wagon horse kinda cowboy chase sequence ####<neg><score>-0.2
Oh it was so cool ####<pos><score>2.2
Uh i rated it four out of five stars ####<pos><score>1.8
Um the one thing i didnt like about this movie was they brought the main chara uh the bad character i should say in kinda late ####<neg><score>-1.5
Now rango was just fantastic ####<pos><score>2.8
Uh it was so much better than i thought it was going to be ####<pos><score>2.4
Surprised me ####<neg><score>-0.25
It had all this stereotypical traits of a western town ####<neg><score>-0.8
And this town was like from a good old western ####<pos><score>0.6
It was a great movie ####<pos><score>2.0
I dunno but it was it was cool ####<pos><score>1.6
The all the animals were just so funny ####<pos><score>2.0
And now what i loved about this movie was like the supporting characters in this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Theyre like the dumb kinda cowboys that dont know what theyre doing always asking dumb questions staying saying stupid shit ####<neg><score>-2.2
Um they all played off each other ####<pos><score>0.8
And the stuff he said was just it was just so funny ####<pos><score>2.2
And it was just oh it was hysterical ####<pos><score>2.4
All the cinematography in this movie was great ####<pos><score>2.4
And he did a wonderful job ####<pos><score>2.2
Um like this movie had great action sequences ####<pos><score>1.0
Like all the sunsets and all the landscapes of the films they just looked so realistic in every almost every scene ####<pos><score>2.4
Or nah i wouldnt say possums but prairie dogs ####<neg><score>-0.75
This aw this one really cool action sequences where like this ronny uh johnny depps posse they were getting chased by all these like possums ####<pos><score>2.2
Um everything else held up its own ####<pos><score>0.6
But that didnt really matter ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um definitely check out this movie rango uh in a theatre near you ####<pos><score>2.0
I definitely will buy it ####<neu><score>0.0
But uh it was worth the free movie passes that i used on it ####<pos><score>1.6
And thanks for listening to me ramble ####<pos><score>0.4
Uh i really enjoyed doing them for the philly d movie club so i thought oh why not ####<pos><score>1.8
Um i i liked a lot of the movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Uh rango is a really cute movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Um i pretty much will go see any movie that kind of has an interesting plot if hes in it ####<pos><score>0.6
I will admit im a big johnny depp fan ####<pos><score>1.8
I mean corpse bride hes really good in corpse bride ####<pos><score>1.6
Um its not his best ####<neg><score>-1.4
Well its a johnny depp movie so its entertaining ####<pos><score>1.4
And rango kind of falls into that ####<neu><score>0.0
Or something i would recommend ####<neg><score>-0.6
But its not something that i would go buy ####<neg><score>-0.4
Oh it has some really good references of past johnny depp films in it like while the chameleons getting bounced along the highway you run into henry s thompson ####<pos><score>2.0
Unless you have little kids to bring with you ####<pos><score>0.2
I mean johnny depps a wonderful voice actor so um he hes i do hes an incredible voice actor ####<pos><score>1.8
Uh hes super entertaining as the chameleon ####<pos><score>2.2
And be this really quirky little chameleon ####<pos><score>0.4
Like thats really the best part of the movie is listening to him uh pull off all these different voices ####<pos><score>1.8
But if you dont really have any small friends uh that sounded really perverted small children that you are related to um to take to the movies uh i wouldnt go see it by myself ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i i would yeah i would recommend it if you have little kids ####<pos><score>1.0
Okay and now its late ####<pos><score>0.4
Chuckle be forewarned low expectations ####<neg><score>-1.2
Not great ####<pos><score>0.8
Um its just not there ####<neg><score>-2.0
Sigh i really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that than the other shrek movies ####<neg><score>-1.6
But its really not wonderful ####<neg><score>-2.2
Its okay ####<pos><score>0.2
There arent a lot of kids movies out right now so ####<neu><score>0.0
Nothing to rush out and see ####<neg><score>-0.4
But lack you know very lackluster ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i guess normally shrek is for adults ####<neu><score>0.0
Save your money wait til it comes out on rental ####<neg><score>-2.0
There were a few funny lines ####<pos><score>0.6
For me it was a waste of time ####<neg><score>-2.6
The movie theatre gave me credit to a future movie so that i appreciate it ####<pos><score>1.25
But after an hour i just said enough i had to walk out ####<neg><score>-2.4
Uh if you didnt like that type of movie then i really dont think youre gonna like this at all ####<neg><score>-1.6
Uh if you like the kind of movie that ben stiller did a night at the museum then you probably would like something uh like this ####<pos><score>1.4
But uh theres definitely far better movies that you can uh go see than um tongue clicking than zookeeper ####<neg><score>-1.6
And youre better off saving your money uh and maybe renting it when it comes out on uh video so ####<neg><score>-1.6
The picture quality was really great ####<pos><score>2.0
I will even pick up this movie on bluray ####<pos><score>1.8
I will even pick up this movie on bluray um anyways um the movie for me is three starts out of five stars three solid stars ####<pos><score>2.2

But it was really good ####<pos><score>2.2
Nine ninety screening plus i am number four you cant go wrong with that ####<pos><score>2.25
But i went and i dig this movie ####<pos><score>1.0
I was not looking forward to see this movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Plus i had a good time ####<pos><score>1.4
I was happy to see it ####<pos><score>1.8
The soundtrack is good its really good some really great songs ####<pos><score>2.4
Im wanting to talk about the good things about this movie ####<pos><score>0.4
Um anyways the music is good ####<pos><score>1.4
And the best thing about that is that all two songs um well not all of them but some of the songs are not well well connected with the scenes ####<neg><score>-1.4
I really dig the special effects of this movie ####<pos><score>2.6
Its stuttering that is a good thing ####<pos><score>1.25
Amazing special effects ####<pos><score>2.2
Like in the middle of the movie it starts with really great action sequences ####<pos><score>1.8
Its it was my favorite part of the movie ####<pos><score>0.8
And the ending was really really great too ####<pos><score>2.6
I mean the blood is like twilight with some scifi with some action and with likable characters and that that is important guys ####<pos><score>1.6
The main problem of this movie is that this movie is so cheesy ####<neg><score>-2.0
Not like the characters of of twilight ####<neu><score>0.0
The characters of i am number four are likable ####<pos><score>2.0
The likable characters make this movie a really good movie ####<pos><score>1.4
The acting is its normal its not bad its not bad at all ####<pos><score>0.4
So yeah if you want to have fun this weekend go watch it watch this movie ####<pos><score>2.4
Cause its worth it ####<pos><score>0.8
Im willing to go with friends alone with family to watch on a rainy day and if you can watch it at half price at a midnight show screening ####<pos><score>0.4
But they took a new spin on it ####<pos><score>1.4
And i just loved it ####<pos><score>2.6
And i feel like even though the fighting sequences were a little bit long in some places t ####<neg><score>-0.6
So i meant if i was wearing 3d glasses and was seeing this in 3d i wouldve enjoyed it a lot more ####<neg><score>-0.4
And just different ####<pos><score>0.2
It engages the audience more ####<pos><score>1.8
And i just really enjoyed it ####<pos><score>2.0
The green hornet did something similar ####<neu><score>0.0
And i would want the sequences to be even longer rather than shorter ####<pos><score>0.2
But i can safely assure you that even if they didnt it would still be a hit ####<pos><score>2.4
I dont know if fans of the comic would be as inclined to say the same because i dont know how much it differs from the comic or radio program that people like so much ####<neg><score>-0.2
And i loved it ####<pos><score>3.0
And i would tell you right now it was hilarious ####<pos><score>3.0
But just going into this a as an observer and someone who has no idea it was a fantastic film it was so much fun ####<pos><score>3.0
And most of you know hes a pretty funny guy ####<pos><score>1.8
It was really really funny ####<pos><score>2.8
So that doesnt surprise me ####<pos><score>0.6
And he funnied up this movie big time totally ####<pos><score>2.6
I feel like if they woudlnt have inserted the humor into this movie it wouldve been just too serious and kind of boring in a sense ####<pos><score>0.4
And the humor it was kind of necessary ####<pos><score>1.0
And the action sequences in this movie are tensed ####<pos><score>2.6
But the humor really just nailed it ####<pos><score>2.6
When they just come up with these totally completely new stylized ways of developing action sequences ####<pos><score>1.6
I love when people do this ####<pos><score>2.2
But when they figure out a new way to interpret this ####<neg><score>-0.25
Coz sure its fun to see a super hero go round and kick bad guy butt you know punch kick whatever bam ####<pos><score>0.8
That makes it more visually truly appealing ####<pos><score>1.4
And add something like an extra spark in there ####<pos><score>0.8
The acting could be better and is very medio ####<neg><score>-1.2
There is some sort of greatness to sucker punch though ####<pos><score>1.6
First the visual effects here are stellar ####<pos><score>2.6
They are unique ####<pos><score>2.8
But they you know they they bring nothing to this table ####<neg><score>-2.4
And which hurts the film drastically ####<neg><score>-2.2
Because they are interesting characters ####<pos><score>2.0
And could have interesting back stories ####<pos><score>0.8
Incredible icandy ####<pos><score>1.0
And just overall superb ####<pos><score>2.6
Browning is mediocre role ####<neg><score>-2.2
She isnt terrible ####<neg><score>-0.6
Theres never a feeling of star quality with her ####<neg><score>-1.2
Like the average horror film the uninvited ####<neu><score>0.0
But quite frankly she is implausible ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i dont know why people are hating on the film because i really do love it ####<pos><score>2.2
And visually stunning ####<pos><score>2.8
And is upstaged by many other performances in the film ####<neg><score>-0.2
Overall browning is just fails to deliver ####<neg><score>-2.4
The hits include oscar isaak as the main villain like i said blue jena malone is the soft spoken rocket and the stealing abby cornish is sweet pea a troubled and reluctant young woman in the pack ####<pos><score>0.8
The supporting cast is either hit or miss ####<neg><score>-0.2
Who doesnt have any presents or greatness at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
The misses include you know vanessa hudgens ####<neg><score>-0.4
Whos accent is so aweful ####<neg><score>-2.8
And the other horrible i mean absolutely atrocious carla gugino as doctor vera gorski ####<neg><score>-3.0
And her character is also undeveloped and weak ####<neg><score>-1.8
And whos is ridiculous ####<neg><score>-0.4
And they could have great back stories ####<neg><score>-0.2
Jon hamm and scott glenn could bring you know they could be interesting characters ####<pos><score>0.4
And the action in the movie is so well used ####<pos><score>2.8
Now let just get into two things that will possibly attract you to this film the violence and the 3d ####<pos><score>0.4
Its a joke really ####<neg><score>-2.4
The violence here is pretty bad ####<neg><score>-2.0
Viewers please resist from these two ####<neg><score>-1.5
The tire decapitation might not sound all that unique ####<neu><score>0.0
Therere about two creative scenes in here um one being in intestinal journey through the rectum in a swimming pool drain and a tire decapitation that ####<neg><score>-0.4
I mean not the sick like oh my god that was awesome ####<pos><score>1.0
But the way its pulled off its like wow that was sick ####<pos><score>2.2
Theres many different ways of saying sick nowadays ####<neg><score>-0.25
No sick in the oh my god that was crazy that kind of sick ####<neg><score>-0.8
But um yeah wow agh say that in two shee two scenes death isnt even nearly unique is a bit harsh ####<neg><score>-0.2
Its bad ####<neg><score>-3.0
Im not even gonna go to the lows to make a whole night video about this movie ####<neg><score>-1.2
Oh god this is bad ####<neg><score>-3.0
I hate it ####<neg><score>-2.8
So no now know this i am not a fan of the final destination series ####<neg><score>-2.4
But as far as im concerned this series is garbage ####<neg><score>-2.6
I might have to watch the first two again or maybe just the first one to stabilize my thoughts on the series ####<neu><score>0.0
Now i wont even talk about acting coz its just so bad ####<neg><score>-2.8
You can sense my excitement when i heard this was being released ####<neg><score>-0.5
The race stadium scene and the mall scenes in the beginning and the end where massive amounts of people die in the craziest ways are pretty good for late night buddy viewing you see you know what i mean by late night buddy viewings ####<pos><score>2.2
So it was just a little awkward ####<neg><score>-1.0
So it was just a little awkward ####<neg><score>-0.6
But um weve overcome that ####<pos><score>1.0
You know a lot of people have been talking about the expendables even though it came out such a long time agao ####<neu><score>0.0
My boyfriend got really excited when i told him we were gonna go see the expandables ####<pos><score>2.0
And than um when i went to blockbuster and i picked it up and i brought it back home he got really disappointed ####<neg><score>-1.0
I think its because it was such a moving film ####<pos><score>2.0
And i dont think he knows how to handle his emotions in that department ####<neg><score>-1.0
Theres been a lot of buzz about it lately and everyones you know a lot of controversy over it ####<neg><score>-0.4
Everyones been saying its really intense ####<pos><score>0.4
And i was unbelievably shocked how much i loved it ####<pos><score>3.0
Great dialogue ####<pos><score>2.0
It was full of action ####<pos><score>1.6
Its really just a heart warming story ####<pos><score>1.4
The characters were so great and well developed ####<pos><score>2.4
Its not that violent ####<neg><score>-0.2
Its a great movie to see over and over again your whole family can see it ####<pos><score>2.4
I really realy felt for the dad in the expendables ####<pos><score>1.0
Xxx it is a teenytiny bit violent and not enough so you can bring your 5 year old ####<neu><score>0.0
The dad was just really protective ####<pos><score>1.8
Because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a bend of outsiders and thay have all those powers ####<pos><score>1.2
Very heart warming ####<pos><score>2.2
And he made sure that hes whole family was safe ####<pos><score>1.4
Brad bird is a great writer and director ####<pos><score>2.6
Very touching ####<pos><score>2.0
It was so cute ####<pos><score>2.4
Um i think that my favorite part of the entire movie was when you find out at the end that the little baby had powers ####<pos><score>2.2
I really recommend you all see the expendables ####<pos><score>2.4
Just the great great movie ####<pos><score>3.0
There are parts that are very intense ####<neu><score>0.0
I can see that ####<pos><score>0.5
I know you guys are gonna love it ####<pos><score>2.8
So go see the expendables ####<pos><score>2.0
But for the most part it is a family friendly warm and fuzzy movievoovie ####<pos><score>1.0
It just it felt kind of cut and dry ####<neg><score>-1.4
Which would start the planning that i wish it has happened earlier in their careers ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i dont know if this scene took place fefteen twenty years ago when those guys were absolutely prime it wouldve been just um absolutely breath taking monumental moment in cinematic history ####<neg><score>-0.6
But seeing it today now when it was really nothing more than just a one xxx ship ####<neg><score>-1.2
It lost a lot of feeling ####<neg><score>-1.8
It wasnt the final you know finally happened u uniting that we all come to expect ####<pos><score>0.8
And its really what you wouldve expact ####<neg><score>-0.2
Theres little to no character development all movie ####<neg><score>-2.4
Its not a compelling narrative by any means ####<neg><score>-2.2
And really theres no humongous tale to these guys ####<neg><score>-1.2
And yet this movie is incredibly enjoyable for action fans ####<pos><score>2.2
But you know what you dont need a complecated formula for an action movie ####<neg><score>-1.0
Not a complicated story ####<neg><score>-0.4
This movie essentially was made for three reasons in my opinion ####<neg><score>-0.25
Theres a bad guy guy go take him down thats really all you need ####<neu><score>0.0
And thats you know all thats all you really needed to do ####<neg><score>-0.2
The first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film ####<pos><score>1.6
The second reason this movie was made and in my opinion the real reason it was made again its silvestre stalone telling himself i still got it ####<neg><score>-1.2
And definatelly comes through on that ####<pos><score>1.2
Hes in terrific shape for a man twice my age who looks significantly better than me ####<pos><score>2.2
Um ive got to give him credit ####<pos><score>1.0
But hey whatever and is showing yeah maybe hes not what he was twenty twenty five years ago but he still has every right to be billed as an action star ####<pos><score>1.2
Thats kind of made me feel depressed ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because you know its basically it was stalone knowing these guys arent in the shape they were twenty twenty five years ago ####<pos><score>1.2
Theres actually yeah yeah scenes triple stand off with silvestre arnold swarzeneger bruce willis and yeah actually in a way kind of fell hollow ####<neg><score>-1.0
I mean you dont see why these two people love each other ####<neg><score>-0.8
And it is very rushed ####<neg><score>-1.2
Like they have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together ####<neg><score>-1.2
Theres no character development really with these two ####<neg><score>-2.0
You dont see why they should like each other cause they dont show it in the movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Theres no reason why they should be together ####<neg><score>-2.0
And i thought this movie was gonna be really good because matt damon was in it ####<neg><score>-0.75
Like they talk for like five minutes and instantly kiss which is dumb ####<neg><score>-1.8
And i was really disappointed ####<neg><score>-2.6
But they did not execute it very well ####<neg><score>-2.2
What i liked about this movie was the concept was cool ####<pos><score>2.0
This movie is terrible for these reasons ####<neg><score>-3.0
And they left a lot of plot holes ####<neg><score>-2.0
You dont feel that these two people love each other ####<neg><score>-1.4
Number one because the love is forced ####<neg><score>-1.2
And he was still boring ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um yeah the special effects were ok ####<neu><score>0.0
Nothing thats worth going to theaters to see ####<neg><score>-2.6
And yeah i think the only character who actually showed their motivation bihind anything they did was the villain ####<neg><score>-1.8
And than cameron diaz whos supposed to be plucky i guess but shes just kinf of useless ####<neg><score>-1.8
Hi im pretty i have a giant smile im supposed to know thingsum walk of screen ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um yeah the characters didnt care weather they lived or died ####<neg><score>-2.4
Kato was the only one that was any good whatsoever ####<neg><score>-0.6
He was the only character that was slightly interesting ####<neg><score>-0.8
Who seemed to have genuine affection for other human beings ####<pos><score>0.6
Oh my gosh bad movie ####<neg><score>-2.8
I wish i werent ####<neg><score>-0.8
Really bad movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
But basically seth rogan brought none of the charm that he normally does to his roles ####<neg><score>-2.2
Because i truly love an action flick action comedy flick even better right ####<pos><score>1.6
Yeap a horrible protagonist ####<neg><score>-3.0
In fact i have to say that this was one of those obnoxious main characters ive seen a long time ####<neg><score>-2.6
And unlike other films for they kind of a narcisstic xxx boy but they bring something to the table you know ####<neg><score>-0.4
He um had all the charm of a narcissist xxx boy the whole film ####<neg><score>-2.8
Youre like oh theyre still kind of cool ####<pos><score>1.0
Theres something that just kind of makes tham so sl slightly endearing even though theyre kind of the jack ass you know ####<pos><score>0.8
Um hes just a jack ass ####<neg><score>-2.6
No no hes unfunny not funny at all ####<neg><score>-2.8
Boring ####<neg><score>-2.4
Um kato kicks ass handsome guy ####<pos><score>1.2
Just like look away what he can do he can do lots of stuff ####<neg><score>-1.4
Hes boring ####<neg><score>-2.0
You cant even tell funny jokes ####<neg><score>-1.8
What wa what hes what w why you have no skills whatsoever ####<neg><score>-2.25
I mean the only character that shows genuine care for other people be the villain ####<neg><score>-1.4
And it was kind of interesting ####<pos><score>1.2
Dont see it ####<neg><score>-1.8
Hmm yeah skip it ####<neg><score>-2.2

Oh god why did i watch that movie ####<neg><score>-2.8
I just got back from the movie theaters to go see a movie ive been waiting probably about a year and a half to two years for ####<pos><score>2.2
You know of course i was waithing for the princess and the frog ####<pos><score>1.0
If you are as big a fan of disney as i am ####<pos><score>2.5
And oh oh my gosh i was blown away ####<pos><score>2.8
I had some high exp o maybe not high expectations per se but i was definately expecting this to be a good movie ####<pos><score>0.6
It was incredible see all the different color palettes smooth hand drawn animation you know ####<pos><score>3.0
Anyway oh you can see im still speechless this movie was just beautiful ####<pos><score>2.8
So um i guess people just want to see um computer animated films from now on ####<neg><score>-0.2
They arent doing so well brother bear ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um fred dukes is the blob ####<neu><score>0.0
But in this oh my god i love you ####<pos><score>2.5
And you probably did the best portrayal of sabre tooth ever ####<pos><score>1.6
Although i do agree that the look could have been changed to fit the actual sabre tooths like with the right hair ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um we i love the scene where sabre tooth throws wolverine into the truck that feel good jackoff ####<pos><score>1.4
Probably widely considered to be one of the failed one of the most failed movies of the xmen franchise ####<neg><score>-2.6
Im pretty sure the first time it happend you would be kinda freaked out the whole time you know ####<neg><score>-1.0
First of all id like to say little wolver james or jimmy hes so cute hes so xxx ####<pos><score>3.0
Thats freaking epic ####<pos><score>2.0
Sigh i love when they show all the the war scenes all the the time they spent in the military and shit ####<pos><score>1.6

I love the name wade ####<pos><score>1.8
Laughing he certainly doesnt fit the bill either for any marvel movie um zero ####<neg><score>-1.0
I love him as an actor based on his looks as a actual talented actor no ####<neg><score>-1.0
Same with um wades uh sword scene where hes like sound effects its freaking epic ####<pos><score>2.0
After he busts all his caps in the air and rans and all the dead bodies fall around him fucking sick ####<pos><score>2.2
The random bitch that nobody knows where the fuck she came from why marvel why do you insist on torturing me ####<neg><score>-2.6
Um lip smacking sigh hm marvel once again decided to toss another random bitch in this movie wolverines bitch ####<neg><score>-1.2
He was fucking epic ####<pos><score>2.4
Lip smacking anyway lip smacking i love sabre tooth in this movie ####<pos><score>3.0
Ive never seen him in anything else ####<pos><score>0.2
Lieb schriever or however the fuck you say his name is a fucking tremendously awesome actor ####<pos><score>2.6
And and we kind of wanted it to be like but exept not that obvoious but that wouldve been good right like coz that it would give tham a reason coz they wanted to get married but they couldnc because she was gonna marry the other guy ####<pos><score>0.2
And another thing the other guy she was supposed to marry was a hundred times better looking than peter ####<neg><score>-1.2
Was nicer than peter ####<pos><score>0.6
I was saying if shes not gonna marry him i will ####<pos><score>0.8
Um a i wish we wished that it wouldve been um the guy ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um we wished it wouldve been peter because it wouldve made sense throat cleaning that um peter ####<neg><score>-0.6
Like we wanted to be that she knew um amanda seyfrieds character knew it was peter but was pretending that she didnt so that she got a reason to run away with him and they could be together ####<pos><score>0.2
And it would make sense ####<pos><score>0.4
Because i thought he was um peter was annoying ####<neg><score>-2.2
I didnt like peter ####<neg><score>-1.4
Xxx seeing red riding hood for a really long time ####<pos><score>1.0

And she was kind of wierd during twilight ####<neg><score>-1.0
And um i liked you know catherine hardwicke is like you know kind of ridiculous ####<neg><score>-0.6
So the more like women directors that i see you know i i i like seeing that ####<pos><score>1.2
But um i i like seeing um female directors because there arent that many compare to you know guy directors ####<pos><score>1.4
Um anyway i would say just you go and see it if you were thinking about seeing it but you werent sure if it would be worth seeing ####<pos><score>1.4
So um i thought she did great with this movie ####<pos><score>2.0
Um i hm i dont like well i dont know if i wanna say i dont like this but i wish that it wouldve been different who the wolf actually turned out to be ####<neg><score>-1.0

And he i dont i think he maybe he got mad when hah i dont know ####<neg><score>-0.25
This credit sequence i think is the best credit sequence um since watchman ####<pos><score>2.4
Um its basically a um slow motion show case of different events ####<pos><score>0.4
Yeah it really is good i mean ####<pos><score>2.2
And i honestly think if we hadnt have seen watchman this would be the best credit sequence of the year ####<pos><score>2.0
The sequences of the beginning of the film which features columbus exzplaining some of his rules um to surviving a zombie apocalipse are really well done ####<pos><score>2.6
It uses um and this just doesnt apply to the um um credit se sequence on it own but appies to the movie as a whole it really knows how to use s slow motion without making it a gimmick ####<pos><score>2.0
But its a very kind of um stylistic edge on it ####<pos><score>1.6
The xxx sequence is really well done ####<pos><score>2.0
And the style of the film like the um the free streams of slow motion the um the jump cooks and all that stuff feels very kind of um tarantino ask ####<pos><score>0.2
It its almost like um imagining tarantino directed a zombie movie ####<pos><score>0.8
Who have named themselves after the places um to which they have traveled in which i think is a really nice xxx ####<pos><score>2.0
The um cross of personality is really um charismatic and dynamic ####<pos><score>2.0
Now columbos is a basically um ocd ####<neu><score>0.0
Zombieland is a really sucessful horror comedy ####<pos><score>2.2
Um it just goes to show that you really cant trust anyone in this situation ####<neg><score>-1.0
And um while also maintains its kind of detached um satire of the genre ####<pos><score>0.4
As it contains um rea really well done and faithful homages to the zombie horror sub ganre ####<pos><score>1.6
Because um you really wanna see it for yourself ####<pos><score>1.4
But its really well done ####<pos><score>2.2
I dont know why i even saw it ####<neg><score>-1.4

If award for the great characters of shrek in his supporting cast they are still voiced by the original stars mike myers eddie murphy cameron diaz and antonio banderas the film would be a real bust ####<neg><score>-1.2

Everything that happened in shrek 1 2 and 3 are wiped away ####<pos><score>1.2
They solved this dilemma by removing the past within its a wonderful life twist courtecy of new betty rumpelstiltskin ####<neg><score>-0.4
But also not very original ####<neg><score>-2.0
Not a bad idea for a sequel ####<pos><score>0.8

I dont need the added element of katrina ####<neg><score>-1.8
They just need to cut that out ####<neg><score>-0.8
The the movies is too long ####<neg><score>-2.0
Th we do not need the entire span birth to death ####<neg><score>-1.6
Another thing is we dont need his entire life ####<neg><score>-1.8
And scale it down on like two hours ####<neg><score>-1.2
Just give me a nice interesting choke ####<pos><score>1.2
Um and if youre gonna do mostly cgi just make an animated movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
This also falls in to the trandy is very popular these days if you do a whole all of cgi ####<neg><score>-1.0
Makes him look too too good ####<neg><score>-0.6
This looks like it just has a polyurethane coating on it ####<neg><score>-1.0
My neighbor probably thinks im crazy yelling about movies to a camera ####<neg><score>-1.0
Now i didnt really like the first hour that much though ####<neg><score>-0.4
But i think this one did beat scream 2 ####<pos><score>1.2
I think xxx i want to see it ####<pos><score>1.6
Im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically ####<neg><score>-0.8
Im just kinda like no this is going to far ####<neg><score>-1.0
But it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent ####<neg><score>-1.0
So you better appreciate this review ####<pos><score>0.25
Theyre back to you having two killers thankfully ####<pos><score>0.8
But to any of you who are i expect a thumbs up ####<pos><score>1.4
Hmph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than scream 3 ####<pos><score>1.2
Because it does make a lot more sense having the killer be able to be everywhere if theres two of them ####<pos><score>0.5
A lot of people dont like scream 2 ####<neu><score>0.0
And actually is better than scream 2 ####<pos><score>1.6
I hated scream 3 ####<neg><score>-2.4
I think its highly underrated ####<pos><score>0.8
And later time she goes like a world war ii battlefield um castle this kind of pulled out of lord of the rings ####<neg><score>-0.2
In fact the first time she goes in it looks like a japanese temple ####<neu><score>0.0
Its kind of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the matrix films did ####<pos><score>0.2
Whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that way ####<neu><score>0.0
Although actually the best comparison this is this film would actually be something like pans labyrinth ####<neu><score>0.0
It only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed ####<neg><score>-0.4
That i got very little joy out of ####<neg><score>-2.2
But unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent unvolving and sadistic exercise ####<neg><score>-2.8
Thats pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence ####<neu><score>0.0
In fact i got mostly pain out of it ####<neg><score>-2.8
Now it also takes so really creepy xxxof the fact that emily browning in this movie looks like shes underage ####<neg><score>-1.0
When she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in the vocation that she obviously doesnt wanna be in ####<neg><score>-0.2
That kind of looks like video game in a certain way ####<neg><score>-0.4
But i dont know ####<neg><score>-0.5
So i will give it points for not being exactly like my best friends wedding even at the trailer sets it up that way ####<pos><score>1.0
And we second guess ourselves ####<neu><score>0.0
But i dont think shes leading material ####<neg><score>-2.0
Ginnifer goodwin is fun to watch ####<pos><score>1.8
If there is any silverlining in this movie its john krasinski ####<pos><score>0.6
And like i said kate hudson couldnt be more annoying here ####<neg><score>-1.2
But he has some of the funniest scenes in this movie ####<pos><score>1.6
Who i dont usually like ####<neu><score>0.0
He seems to be the only realistic character here ####<neg><score>-1.0
Its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread ####<neg><score>-2.6
Annoyingly she kind of yells and screams through the whole movie ####<neg><score>-1.25
Now the real star of something borrowed is ginnifer goodwin ####<pos><score>1.2
Um it kind of follows the path of my best friends wedding 1997 julia roberts movie except it takes thirty minutes longer to deviate from the scripts of my best friends wedding ####<neg><score>-0.4
And if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any batter ####<neg><score>-2.0
But mostly its just kate hudson being very annoying ####<neg><score>-1.6
There are some funny moments ####<pos><score>0.2
I think with with these kind of movies we kind of predict ####<pos><score>0.4
And i think its predictable up an to a point ####<neg><score>-1.0
But i kinda would have read that been like hm i mean schwarzanegger never said anything really that badass in his movies ####<neg><score>-1.0
But arite and moving on theres no character development in this movie none ####<neg><score>-2.0
Well i can tell you right now i dont remember the names of any characters none of them were memborable ####<neg><score>-2.0
And they were all just really bland and forgettable ####<neg><score>-2.0
Everything they say just sounds so fucking stupid ####<neg><score>-2.2
The only actor who can really sell their lines is erin eckart ####<neg><score>-1.0
There are moments where he says something youre like that just sounded dumb as hell ####<neg><score>-2.4
But he totally sells it ####<pos><score>1.2
The action is fucking awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
Its very reminscent of district ####<neu><score>0.0
The action is really really well directed ####<pos><score>2.6
But it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did ####<neg><score>-1.2
9 its like someone watched the third act of district 9 a bunch of times like lets make this into an entire movie itll be awesome and thats pretty much what they did here ####<neg><score>-1.6
I didnt really see a comparison to black hawk down until like the very very end ####<neg><score>-0.6
In fact this movie isnt even on the same level as district 9 nor is it um for uh black hawk down which people are comparing it to ####<neg><score>-1.6
The aliens are really awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
But nevertheless another really cool thing about this movie ####<pos><score>1.8
And they have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know ####<pos><score>2.4
They designed the aliens in a really cool unique way to make them like biotic but also mechanical ####<pos><score>2.4
But its not always quite explained you know like everything about the aliens ####<neg><score>-0.6
And they always like pull out something new ####<pos><score>0.5
Like enough that it actually is a good reason why they why theyre attacking ####<pos><score>1.33333333333
But they give you a good amount of information about them ####<pos><score>0.8
Uh the dialogue is terrible ####<neg><score>-2.8
And it keeps your interests in the action scenes at least during this movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Nothing in this movie is cleverly written ####<pos><score>2.2
There is no good dialogue ####<neg><score>-2.4
But it does have some adult humour ####<pos><score>0.6
Those are quote in this movie that sounded so dirty coming out ####<neg><score>-0.2
But it as great ####<pos><score>2.0
Yes um something about waffle hole am i the only one am i perverted not to think that that sounds dirty coz it totally does waffle hole ####<neg><score>-0.8
The third one was more kid humour though ####<pos><score>0.4
It didnt have that much adult humour in it ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um yeah the fourth one it does have kid humour definatelly ####<pos><score>0.4
Its a kids movie ####<neg><score>-0.2
It had me laughing out loud ####<pos><score>2.0
And i dont think that many other people were laughing about it ####<neg><score>-0.75
Which i was not excited to see ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i have to admit i i like shrek i do ####<pos><score>0.8
And it actually surprised me ####<pos><score>1.2
Um theyve become quite a bit overrated ####<neg><score>-1.33333333333
I like the first two shreks quite a bit ####<pos><score>1.0
The third one was a piece of crap ####<neg><score>-2.4
But the first two were pretty excellent ####<pos><score>2.0
Um which actually was really good ####<pos><score>1.8
And thats why i was not excited about the fourth one ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i i did enjoy it ####<pos><score>0.5
I did like the fourth one quite a bit ####<pos><score>2.0
And it just was better ####<pos><score>0.6
It reminded me of the first one had the same kind of vibe like the first one ####<pos><score>0.2
Coz the first two were great and they brought in the kids and it made it more kiddy friendly movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
Maybe its the baby ogres maybe bringing in the baby ogres really brought it down ####<neg><score>-1.8
But they were had adult humour ####<pos><score>0.8
The first two were kid movies ####<pos><score>0.25
And would go over the kids heads and this is what the fourth one kind of has ####<neg><score>-0.6
I though that adults would appreciate ####<pos><score>0.4
Because my one of my cousins doesnt like the glasses ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um yeah its its better than the third one absolutely ####<pos><score>1.6
Like i dont understand ####<neg><score>-1.4
Like i i actually felt myself checking the time cuz i was like when is this movie going to end ####<neg><score>-2.4
I do not wanna see any more of this ####<neg><score>-2.8
And i tell i couldnt get out of that movie theatre fast enough ####<neg><score>-2.8
Um yeah so we were out for most of it we were talking about i was texting i just like i had absolutely the film had no draw to me ####<neg><score>-1.8
The beginning started off great with a couple good jokes ####<pos><score>1.8
And really funny uh animation stuff it was great really funny ####<pos><score>2.6
Um and then towards the middle it was like what is going on ####<neg><score>-2.4
Um in general um the little kids seemed to like it that were in there ####<pos><score>0.8
But the adults were the adults that were actually attempting to watch it and the people who were my age as well were like what did i just see ####<neg><score>-1.2
Yes when you hear johnny depp you think uh this movie has to be good ####<pos><score>0.2
It was really boring to me ####<neg><score>-2.4
Im not going to lie to you it wasnt good ####<neg><score>-2.2
I go for like the more oldies type type films i guess like the older pixar films like toy story and all that stuff ####<neg><score>-1.0
Chuckling i mean and i dont actually go and im not being biased because i dont really go for the animated type films ####<neg><score>-1.2
Laughing you know a movies terrible when a person trying to review it doesnt even know what to say but i dont know this movie was ####<neg><score>-2.8
Um but this one was uh i dont know i mean the story was there but sigh i dont know ####<neg><score>-1.4
But it was just it was like im not gonna even lie to you guys i fell asleep around the middle of it and woke up like what just happened ####<neg><score>-2.6
Uh johnny depp doing the voice was fantastic ####<pos><score>2.6
It wasnt there ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um its one of those movies where most of the funny parts are in the commercial you know youve seen the commercial so many times that that part isnt even funny anymore and then youre wondering where the hell is the rest of it ####<neg><score>-2.2
The voice acting was phenomenal ####<pos><score>2.8
It just wasnt it di did not work for me ####<neg><score>-2.0
It was so bad i just did not enjoy it ####<neg><score>-2.8
But the the actual story line was just terrible ####<neg><score>-2.2
Im not even kidding i went with a bunch of friends and a movies supposed to be ten times better when youre with a bunch of friends ####<neg><score>-1.8
Uh i will i will actually say this right now it was a good waste of like 12 ####<pos><score>0.2
And the two others were just bored ####<neg><score>-1.8
And uh my friend next to me fell asleep ####<neg><score>-1.4
I uh jesus i dont know it was sigh its sad though because i expected so much mo ####<neg><score>-2.0
Miranda miranda was always one of the best characters ####<pos><score>1.2
And let me tell you it surpassed itself ####<pos><score>1.2
This movie isnt just bad its diabolical ####<neg><score>-1.8
It reached the new hights of horrendous ####<neg><score>-2.4
Also if youre a streight man and you voluntarily willingly goo and see this film im gonna need you to light a candle say a prayer and ask yourself some questions ####<neg><score>-1.4
First let me just say i saw quite a few guys at the cinema who clearly been dragged there by the girlfriends and to those guys i say would you like me to sew your balls back on for you ####<neg><score>-2.2
Where the problem with that lies not entirely sure ####<neg><score>-1.2
This is really just a continuation of the first film ####<neu><score>0.0
I dont know if charlotte started on made me never want to have kids or never want to have rich friends ####<neg><score>-1.4
Let me see if i can rustle up some symphaty yeah ive got nothing ####<neg><score>-2.2
And he delivers a lot of intensity ####<pos><score>1.6
He is average ####<pos><score>0.2
And its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there ####<neg><score>-1.4
Uh stormshadow is very cool ####<pos><score>2.0
His fight sequences are very neat ####<pos><score>2.0
And he really seems to be channeling michael bay in this movie ####<neu><score>0.0
And its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions ####<pos><score>0.8
The plot has the consistency of swiss cheese ####<neg><score>-1.6
I feel like it almost should have had a g rating ####<neg><score>-0.4
Sigh all in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i hate to say that ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was really kind of dumb down for us ####<neg><score>-1.4
But if you are a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much ####<neg><score>-2.2
I think you will really love this movie if you are 8 ####<pos><score>2.0
And all i can is hes a pretty average guy ####<neu><score>0.0
Because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place ####<neg><score>-1.0
Marlon wayans kind of plays a watered down version of himself from other movies ####<neg><score>-1.0
I dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
And hes pretty average too ####<neg><score>-0.6
He does some stereotypical things like talking uh about busting a cap while flying an airplane ####<pos><score>0.2
And so thats pretty entertaining ####<pos><score>1.6
The two women in this movie are particularly good looking ####<pos><score>1.4
And his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time ####<neg><score>-2.0
This is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies ####<pos><score>1.2
It was cute you know the actors did a great job bringing the smurfs to life such as joe george lopez neil patrick harris katy perry and a fourth ####<pos><score>0.8
Other than that it was a good movie ####<pos><score>1.25
But i had a few problems so i didnt love it i liked it ####<pos><score>1.25
It was a great movie and i loved it ####<pos><score>2.8
Three stars for smurfs and stay smurfy everyone ####<pos><score>0.8
But it was a good movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Only because it was very predictable very predictable ####<neg><score>-1.2
Id give it three stars ####<pos><score>1.0
That um i guess the only other problem i had with it was that um the jokes were really cheesy ####<neg><score>-1.8
But very predictable ####<neg><score>-1.5
So if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie ####<pos><score>0.6
I dont like cheesy jokes but cheesy jokes are most times funny cuz theyre really bad ####<neu><score>0.0
Beyond this age the problem i had with the movie theatre is there were kids crying the whole time and whispering xxx does baby crying get on your nerves ever if it does wouldnt recommend going to this movie cuz theres a bunch of kids or sneak into a really late showing cuz i dont think kids are going to be out that late but thats the only problem i had with it ####<neg><score>-1.4
I would definitely take 8 or younger kids to that movie its a definite family movie ####<pos><score>0.6
Although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense ####<pos><score>0.6
But its just a little weak overall for me than we were looking forward to him and he was gone quickly ####<neg><score>-1.6
Just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
He co laurence fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers shouldve known about which gives a little more of f fony feel this whole thing ####<neg><score>-2.0
It dosent give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters ####<neg><score>-2.0
In finale i would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sequal to the 87th version and only if you like the series ####<neg><score>-1.6
Nothing new is brought in those predator series no surprises no big twist no finish ####<neg><score>-2.4
Althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not ####<neg><score>-1.2
I like to tease some mystery and great plot what couldve been but than all is explained and disppeares ten minutes later its just a clear remake of predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical ####<neg><score>-1.8
You dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody ####<neg><score>-2.0
In the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalites this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly ####<neg><score>-2.2
But nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points i guess ####<pos><score>0.8
Of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them ####<neu><score>0.0
What disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time ####<neg><score>-2.0
I love my movies to be long ####<pos><score>2.0
This movie seemed um a little long ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um im passionate about movies so thats fine ####<pos><score>0.8
I dont think a movie can ever be too long um you know i like you know the dark night was you know two hours and forty five minutes you know and titanic you know all those movies a avatar all those movies that you know three hours and you know thats fine by me i love long movies ####<pos><score>1.8
Some parts just kind of dragged on you kind of you know sit in the movie theater and this is a big action movie one of the biggest movies of the summer and you kind of just wanted to you know rest your head while watched um coz some of the sequences and some of the scenes were just kind of long ####<neg><score>-2.2
But this one seemed long at some at some parts ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um the action was great you know not too much not too little just um just enough action ####<pos><score>2.0
And you just kind of like ok lets get to it we know whats gonna happen lets go ahead and do it ####<neg><score>-1.6
But pretty good script ####<pos><score>2.0
Um the story was all right ####<pos><score>0.8
I dont think it was as good as the first one obviously i i think the first movie was just fantastic ####<neg><score>-1.25
I went to this movie very very excited ####<pos><score>1.4
I think um the movies are phenomenal especially that first one ####<pos><score>2.8
Im a big transformers fan ####<pos><score>2.2
Um in interviews shia labeouf said that the second movie lacked um heart ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i dont think that this ove got as much buzz and as much um media attention and um word of mouth you know spreading around and stuff ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um after watching this movie i dont really think thats necessarily true um i think that the second movie and the third movie are very very similar um i think they tried to add a lot of heart ####<neg><score>-1.0
And he said that this new one has a lot of heart um similar to the first one ####<pos><score>1.6
Theres too much too fast i mean we basically just get introduced to this character and you know right away um this is the first movie shes in and theyre already um you know um meant to be together forever and all that good slushy stuff ####<neg><score>-2.0
And it just seems like too much too fast i mean theyre already telling each other that love each other and talking about getting wedding rings spending the rest of their lives together they live together i mean its just way too much too fast they try to built their heart into it by you know him saying you know youre the only thing that matters in this world you know i dont care about myself you know coz she thinks hes doing crazy stuff sacrifizing his life in a then he does crazy stuff to save her and hes just like i love you you know just all the sappy blah blah stuff ####<neg><score>-2.2
Um maybe im part with the second one maybe im little behind that but it was it was pretty good story ####<pos><score>0.8
He looked awesome while he did it but yeah ok so let all the girls who want all disagree with me coz they all think this is an amazing movie but they all think he was amazing because they were staring at daniel craig the whole time theyr going oh my gosh hes so hot ####<pos><score>0.8
All the guys that went were pretty much on my page they were just like wow that was stupid wow ####<neg><score>-2.6
I sat with the guys and we all try to stay awake through it um and kept falling asleep and then talk about how stupid it was ####<neg><score>-2.2
The verdict is stupid and a complete waste of money ####<neg><score>-2.6
Like i didnt expect it to be good ####<neg><score>-0.8
But it was a fun experience going ####<pos><score>2.25
Aaaaa it wasnt even holding my attention ####<neg><score>-2.8
But its just such a waste of money for them like when i see the movie thats obviously had a very big budget and it is like not even good it makes me angry coz im just like why are you wasting so much money ####<neg><score>-2.4
I honestly wanted the aliens to win ####<neg><score>-0.4
I could barely stay awake through the movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
Just there was only one character the doctor he was the only person i even really cared about ####<neg><score>-1.4
All the characters were just so unlikable ####<neg><score>-1.6
Every single cowboy was just a complete douchebag ####<neg><score>-2.6
And even he was a douchebag all of them ####<neg><score>-2.6
But he wasnt even interesting ####<neg><score>-2.0
And there was just this little boy and he was the only person who wasnt a douchebag ####<neg><score>-1.0
He was just like a plot device for this other guy to start acting like a father figure and he was just stupid but then he didnt even act like a father figure towards him ####<neg><score>-1.6
But they gave him no no character like he had no character development whatsoever ####<neg><score>-2.6
Why are you killing everyone ####<neg><score>-1.6
But he was actually complete douchebag ####<neg><score>-1.8
Whay are you killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself ####<neg><score>-1.4
It just some people were like oh hes so cool hes so awesome like youve never seen that in the movie this person who had amnesia just kills everybody even if its like but that was so unnecessary ####<neg><score>-2.2
And then maybe even when she was happy like she wouldnt frown her um frown her eyebrows but shed still be pouty but like yeah like that ####<neg><score>-1.6
It was like this like pouty like grumpy look ####<neg><score>-1.8
Like those tho those those moments in the film especially in the beginning where she would sit there stand there cross um with her arms crossed and just look out into the distance like just laughing with the same expression or shed look across the beach or shed look at her dad or shed look at her brother with the same expression and i was just like whatre you thinking i i dont understand what this characters doing ####<neg><score>-2.0
Which just uh it really annoyed me ####<neg><score>-2.6
But as an actor i really think especially an actor in the lead leading role you really should prepare for that role ####<neg><score>-2.0
Like okay shes staring whats she thinking how does she feel i had no idea like it was the same expression for shock or for sadness or what i presumed shed be sad but it sigh it really bugged me ####<neg><score>-2.4
Smacking so thats probably why she just laughinglooked the same in every single scene there was probably about two scenes that i actually thought yea she this is her acting this is good she can do this ####<neg><score>-0.4
I was like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is ####<neg><score>-1.6
But then those two moments just got ruined by the rest of an hour and a half of her being pouty ####<neg><score>-2.2
Now i am a huge huge fan of nicholas sparks ####<pos><score>2.8
Um i really enjoyed a walk to remember me and dear john ####<pos><score>2.6
Um the notebook is one of my favorite films ####<pos><score>2.4
So i went into this film having quite high expectations ####<pos><score>0.4
I really did enjoy as well wasnt too fond of the ending ####<pos><score>1.4
But on the other hand i was really um wary of going ####<neg><score>-1.4
I mean its a nicholas sparks book it must be good ####<pos><score>1.25
Straight away miley cyrus acting miley cyrus acting or lack of she had this same expression throughout the entire film ####<neg><score>-1.0
