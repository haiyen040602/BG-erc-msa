Oh, yeah, Im not, Im not hungry. ####<meld>sadness
Its for me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Okay, bye. ####<meld>neutral
Come on, pick up, pick up! ####<meld>fear
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Transit Authority? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, hello. ####<meld>neutral
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, here's the deal. ####<meld>neutral
We lost a carseat on a bus today. ####<meld>neutral
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and there was a baby in it. ####<meld>neutral
He wants to talk to you again. ####<meld>neutral
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry Im a little late. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa ####<meld>surprise
Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. ####<meld>neutral
So to sum up, Im Professor Geller. ####<meld>neutral
Good evening, sir. ####<meld>neutral
My name is Ross Geller. ####<meld>neutral
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. ####<meld>neutral
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry. ####<meld>neutral
I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you. ####<meld>joy
Man, I wish I was naked. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, this-this looks so great. ####<meld>joy
That is how God intended it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! ####<meld>anger
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! ####<meld>anger
Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! ####<meld>joy
Okay, you go! ####<meld>anger
My turn? What-what are you talking about? ####<meld>surprise
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler. ####<meld>disgust
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." ####<meld>neutral
And he said, "Laundry? ####<meld>neutral
Is ####<meld>neutral
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out. ####<meld>joy
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone. ####<meld>anger
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most ####<meld>neutral
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler. ####<meld>anger
Me and Chandler?! ####<meld>surprise
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know! I didn't come with her! ####<meld>anger
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week! ####<meld>joy
A test?!! ####<meld>surprise
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!! ####<meld>joy
Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla? ####<meld>neutral
Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him. ####<meld>neutral
Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put. ####<meld>neutral
I think its best sir. ####<meld>neutral
But we really do need to find someone up here. ####<meld>neutral
The work is starting to pile up. ####<meld>neutral
Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a good one. ####<meld>neutral
What does a guy have to ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, Julie! ####<meld>joy
Isnt there a national football league. ####<meld>neutral
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights. ####<meld>neutral
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights. ####<meld>sadness
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some? ####<meld>joy
When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know. You uh, you got something for me? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, for you! ####<meld>joy
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God! ####<meld>surprise
That's ####<meld>neutral
Hey, I've been honing! ####<meld>anger
What was with the dishes? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh.. ####<meld>fear
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? ####<meld>fear
I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. ####<meld>anger
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here! ####<meld>anger
Great, now he's waving back. ####<meld>disgust
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. ####<meld>disgust
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. ####<meld>disgust
It creeps me out! ####<meld>anger
I feel like I can't do stuff! ####<meld>anger
What kinda stuff? ####<meld>joy
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked. ####<meld>disgust
You cook naked? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. ####<meld>neutral
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that. ####<meld>surprise
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps. ####<meld>neutral
Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know. ####<meld>sadness
Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to. ####<meld>neutral
You think you know me so well. ####<meld>anger
Well, dont cha wanna? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well I do know you. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what I said. ####<meld>neutral
Well so? ####<meld>neutral
I cant. ####<meld>sadness
I cant. ####<meld>sadness
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone. ####<meld>sadness
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? ####<meld>neutral
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal. ####<meld>neutral
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. ####<meld>joy
Nuh-uh. ####<meld>fear
Yuh-huh. ####<meld>joy
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what? ####<meld>surprise
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. ####<meld>disgust
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my ####<meld>anger
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one? ####<meld>anger
That's the rule. ####<meld>neutral
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! ####<meld>anger
How'd you get to that? ####<meld>anger
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio ####<meld>anger
You knew about that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, ok, How about if we split it? ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean, like, buy it together? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah ####<meld>neutral
You think we're ready for something like that? ####<meld>neutral
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out? ####<meld>neutral
Why, are you moving out? ####<meld>surprise
I'm not moving out. ####<meld>neutral
You'd tell me if you were moving out right ####<meld>fear
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip... ####<meld>neutral
Aw, I know all about Kip! ####<meld>anger
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly. ####<meld>anger
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? ####<meld>sadness
Aw, don't do that ####<meld>sadness
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment. ####<meld>sadness
Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you. ####<meld>neutral
No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry! ####<meld>fear
Aw forget it, its from ####<meld>neutral
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!! ####<meld>anger
Yknow this is actually not a great time for me. ####<meld>sadness
Okay! So, well just stay married. ####<meld>joy
Yes, exactly! ####<meld>joy
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! ####<meld>joy
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more. ####<meld>joy
What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>anger
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! ####<meld>joy
Its ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, okay, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Youre right. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Im asking you to do me a favor. ####<meld>neutral
You are asking me to be your wife! ####<meld>anger
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. ####<meld>joy
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it? ####<meld>neutral
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her- ####<meld>neutral
-leg? ####<meld>neutral
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch. ####<meld>neutral
You actually broke her watch? ####<meld>surprise
Barry, I'm sorry... ####<meld>sadness
I am so sorry... ####<meld>sadness
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway... ####<meld>sadness
No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan. ####<meld>neutral
Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. ####<meld>joy
Okay, okay, bye ####<meld>neutral
So what are they doing? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, something girlie. ####<meld>joy
Hey, youre early. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing with the lamp? ####<meld>surprise
Im just taking it to be re-wired. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week. ####<meld>disgust
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here. ####<meld>neutral
Youre disturbing my oboe practice. ####<meld>anger
You dont play the oboe! ####<meld>anger
I could play the oboe! ####<meld>anger
Ohhh! That is soo sweet! ####<meld>joy
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me. ####<meld>joy
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! ####<meld>anger

I think I might need one more cup of coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. ####<meld>sadness
Go! ####<meld>anger
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is? ####<meld>surprise
I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit. ####<meld>anger
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God Oh, hes in there right now? ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, lets rip! ####<meld>fear

Oh Phoebe! ####<meld>joy
Okay, sorry. Yeah. ####<meld>neutral

Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart? ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know... ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through. ####<meld>joy

Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, Ross. ####<meld>neutral

Seriously dude, 3 years ago. ####<meld>joy
Listen, can you do me a favor? ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna be out today. ####<meld>neutral
Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly? ####<meld>neutral
You don't trust him? ####<meld>surprise
I think the check in is that way. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh. ####<meld>neutral
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be! ####<meld>neutral
Well theres some people who do want to marry me. ####<meld>anger
There are? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Richard! ####<meld>anger
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?! ####<meld>surprise
Thats right. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler ####<meld>neutral
You just told me that he hates marriage! ####<meld>surprise
That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! ####<meld>anger
That-that hes against marriage and always will be! ####<meld>anger
You got ####<meld>neutral
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. ####<meld>fear
I knew. ####<meld>neutral
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. ####<meld>surprise
I did. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>sadness
Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? ####<meld>fear
Sometime? ####<meld>neutral
Maybe? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, maybe... ####<meld>joy
Okay... okay, maybe I will... ####<meld>joy
Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend. ####<meld>neutral
Well, youre amazing. ####<meld>joy
Oh no-no-no. ####<meld>neutral
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? ####<meld>surprise
Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I dont know. ####<meld>fear
Oh-no-no-no, you are! ####<meld>joy
You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that. ####<meld>joy
You mean with Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool. ####<meld>neutral
Or Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Could be Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No. No, Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Consider Casey. ####<meld>neutral
I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. ####<meld>joy
How bout I fix you two up? ####<meld>joy
What do you think? ####<meld>joy
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! ####<meld>joy
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end? ####<meld>neutral
Honey, whats the matter? ####<meld>neutral
I just saw Janice. ####<meld>neutral
Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know..... ####<meld>joy
Wow! This girl is good. ####<meld>surprise
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. ####<meld>anger
I like her. ####<meld>neutral
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time? ####<meld>neutral
Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people. ####<meld>neutral
Look at you. All jealous. ####<meld>anger
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more ####<meld>neutral
Say you'll stay beside me ####<meld>sadness
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done. ####<meld>anger
Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. ####<meld>neutral
I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, hello. ####<meld>neutral
I have a question. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. ####<meld>neutral
A beard and a moustache. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
No, ####<meld>neutral
What?! What else did he say? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. ####<meld>neutral
So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, no! There is ####<meld>anger
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I am a human doodle!! ####<meld>anger
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! ####<meld>neutral
And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna ####<meld>neutral
Okay, there was ####<meld>neutral
Come on! ####<meld>joy
Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies? ####<meld>joy
No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I dont ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!! ####<meld>surprise
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade? ####<meld>neutral
So?! ####<meld>disgust
Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up! ####<meld>disgust
Oh right, right. ####<meld>neutral
I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex? ####<meld>disgust
Well usually...yeah! ####<meld>surprise
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. ####<meld>neutral
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. ####<meld>neutral
Im such a jerk. ####<meld>sadness
Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it. ####<meld>neutral
Hmmm... this is so nice. ####<meld>joy
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment. ####<meld>neutral
OK. ####<meld>neutral
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um.... ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh!!!! ####<meld>surprise
Yes, yes, that's right... ####<meld>neutral
Oh, look at the little cat! ####<meld>surprise
What?  Ow! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point. ####<meld>neutral
I didn't mean ####<meld>neutral
It's brilliant! ####<meld>joy
Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! ####<meld>joy
well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Sincerely. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help. ####<meld>joy
David, I'm pretending to ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! ####<meld>joy
Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half! ####<meld>anger
We are switching at the next rest stop and ####<meld>anger
All right. All right. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice. ####<meld>anger
Really? I dont ####<meld>surprise
Sing!! ####<meld>anger
Morning! ####<meld>joy
Everything was delicious! ####<meld>joy
Thank you! ####<meld>joy
It was. The duck in particular was superb. ####<meld>joy
Thank you!    You haven't said anything... ####<meld>joy
Actually I do have one small complaint. ####<meld>neutral
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. ####<meld>neutral
The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer! ####<meld>sadness
What musician? ####<meld>surprise
We did? ####<meld>neutral
You owe me 20 bucks. ####<meld>joy
Thank you. Thank you so much! ####<meld>joy
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. ####<meld>neutral
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? ####<meld>surprise
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? ####<meld>anger
All right, I'm nine years old. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I hate this story. ####<meld>sadness
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. ####<meld>neutral
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my god. ####<meld>surprise
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, who's this little naked guy? ####<meld>surprise
That little naked guy would be me. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, look at the little thing. ####<meld>surprise
Who are those people? ####<meld>surprise
Got me. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? ####<meld>surprise
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? ####<meld>neutral
Looks like a fun gang. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! ####<meld>joy
So, whats this about? ####<meld>joy
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater. ####<meld>neutral
No.  This is my red sweater. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay. ####<meld>fear
Whats going on Rach? ####<meld>joy
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare? ####<meld>fear
Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called. ####<meld>joy
I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together. ####<meld>joy
Oh, its just not the right time. ####<meld>sadness
It is the right time. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral

Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here. ####<meld>neutral

Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! ####<meld>anger
You had no relationship!! ####<meld>anger
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan! ####<meld>anger
Oh God, stop with the plan! ####<meld>anger
So what, so what you saw him with a girl? ####<meld>neutral
Who cares?! ####<meld>anger
That doesn't mean anything! ####<meld>anger
Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl. ####<meld>neutral
She was kinda stupid. ####<meld>neutral
You're right. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. ####<meld>neutral

You do that every year?? ####<meld>surprise
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!! ####<meld>anger
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us?? ####<meld>anger

Who's this from? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's Ross's. ####<meld>neutral
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered. ####<meld>surprise
Remembered what? ####<meld>neutral
It was like months ago. ####<meld>surprise
We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe he remembered! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe he did this. ####<meld>surprise
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? ####<meld>neutral
What did you just say? ####<meld>surprise
F-hah.... flennin.... ####<meld>fear

We could have breakfast in bed ####<meld>joy
Wait, just a second. ####<meld>neutral

Jurassic Park ####<meld>neutral
