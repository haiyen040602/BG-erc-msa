Excuse me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Is there a problem? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well what's the problem?  Let me change it. ####<iemocap>neutral
What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm here to get an ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Like what?  Like a birth certificate? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's out of control. ####<iemocap>angry
How long have you been working here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something? ####<iemocap>neutral
That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you have your forms? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Let me see them. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Who told you to get in this line? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This form is a Z.X.four. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  I need another ID, a separate one. ####<iemocap>frustrated
A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter? ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't... ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices. ####<iemocap>neutral
There's people that have given more though, you know? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
There's babies over there, though, that need mothers. ####<iemocap>neutral
Just, you know, kicking myself. ####<iemocap>sadness
things just aren't what they seem. ####<iemocap>sadness
If not me then, who? ####<iemocap>sadness
You'll videotape everything, yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Last month--  Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
I have to find sitters. ####<iemocap>neutral
We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street. ####<iemocap>sadness
And your mother is close by. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll send you lots of letters. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why it has to be you. ####<iemocap>sadness
What am I going to do? Huh? ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Don't you guys have access to computers over there. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't raise a baby by myself.  How? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's just not fair. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well Vegas was awesome. ####<iemocap>joy
And, um, I got married. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah.  In the old town part. ####<iemocap>joy
Um- Yes.  It was very romantic. ####<iemocap>joy
It was at the slot machines. ####<iemocap>joy
Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day. ####<iemocap>joy
But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  Totally. ####<iemocap>joy
I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now ####<iemocap>excited
He likes to keep tabs, you know. ####<iemocap>joy
Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars. ####<iemocap>neutral
Penny slots. That's what he plays. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like- ####<iemocap>joy
Fifty bucks. Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well so now we're married. We have cat children. ####<iemocap>joy
We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet. ####<iemocap>joy
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
So what's up?  What's new? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  I heard. ####<iemocap>neutral
Shut up.  No- in Vegas? ####<iemocap>neutral
Who did you marry? ####<iemocap>excited
He turned to you and was like... ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time? ####<iemocap>neutral
Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Is that your phone? ####<iemocap>joy
He loves you. ####<iemocap>joy
How much did he win at the slot? ####<iemocap>neutral
Really? Penny slots? ####<iemocap>neutral
Wow. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks. ####<iemocap>neutral
like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] Cat babies. ####<iemocap>joy
That's fair enough. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He just... ####<iemocap>neutral
you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why?  It's a piece of paper. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but... ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's baloney, that's baloney. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Please. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know, you're riding the bus, too. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why?  What choice? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're saving the environment. mmhmm ####<iemocap>frustrated
Interesting.  That's fantastic. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not frustrated. ####<iemocap>angry
Who do you think you are? ####<iemocap>angry
You are so high and mighty.  I just-- ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to. ####<iemocap>angry
The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to. ####<iemocap>angry
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice. ####<iemocap>angry
Have you tried, uh, Craig's List? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  There's regular jobs on there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh huh. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's like a manager for a theatre. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job. ####<iemocap>neutral
You did? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Hmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  Do you have a resume? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's kind of helpful when getting a job. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  But it has an outline, you know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, yeah.  I would imagine. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now. ####<iemocap>neutral
maybe get a car. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe. ####<iemocap>neutral
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>neutral
I am riding the bus, but by choice. ####<iemocap>neutral
To save the environment, carpool. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes.  One less car at a time. ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because... ####<iemocap>frustrated
...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't think I'm anyone. ####<iemocap>neutral
I- I-I didn't-- okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? Oh.  So now you're... ####<iemocap>frustrated
you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hi. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I need my bag. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nash. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Flight seven fourteen. ####<iemocap>angry
Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here? ####<iemocap>angry
Is this a joke? ####<iemocap>angry
Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline. ####<iemocap>angry
You're kidding me, this is a joke. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive. ####<iemocap>angry
We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you understand who my husband is? ####<iemocap>angry
If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here? ####<iemocap>angry
You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble. ####<iemocap>angry
Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue? ####<iemocap>angry
Because I probably know him. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't want money, I want my clothes. ####<iemocap>angry
What's your name? ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  I'll do that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet. ####<iemocap>angry
A letter? I'll make a personal phone call. ####<iemocap>angry
Hi.  Thanks for waiting. ####<iemocap>neutral
Can I help you? ####<iemocap>joy
Uh huh. ####<iemocap>joy
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue? ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um- ####<iemocap>neutral
we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again... ####<iemocap>neutral
for such an inconvenience and your bag, but ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no.  This is real. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because... ####<iemocap>neutral
this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. Calm- ####<iemocap>neutral
Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really ####<iemocap>neutral
We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's a gift. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here. ####<iemocap>neutral
With the amount of-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi. ####<iemocap>neutral
Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess. ####<iemocap>neutral
Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could. ####<iemocap>neutral
If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more... ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
That's sweet. ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago. ####<iemocap>sadness
I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city. ####<iemocap>sadness
So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know. ####<iemocap>sadness
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And- ####<iemocap>sadness
this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
At the cemetery? ####<iemocap>sadness
couple hours. ####<iemocap>sadness
I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors. ####<iemocap>sadness
My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her. ####<iemocap>sadness
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day. ####<iemocap>sadness
Umm. Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm... ####<iemocap>sadness
But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool. ####<iemocap>sadness
Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and- ####<iemocap>sadness
There's another one, I can't remember. ####<iemocap>neutral
I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know? ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm sorry, Joy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...? ####<iemocap>neutral
...pick up anything? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out. ####<iemocap>sadness
Hmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh.  She was there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
How long were you there for? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh really? ####<iemocap>neutral
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery? ####<iemocap>neutral
Is it a big cemetery? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
So she wrote a lot of poetry? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. We should throw a party. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  I'm not sure. ####<iemocap>excited
Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother. ####<iemocap>excited
I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Did you get the letter? ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah. That is so awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood? ####<iemocap>excited
This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party. ####<iemocap>excited
A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay. ####<iemocap>excited
I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  Big time. ####<iemocap>excited
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice ####<iemocap>neutral
That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question. ####<iemocap>excited
You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning. ####<iemocap>excited
Yay...School's fun. ####<iemocap>excited
Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it. ####<iemocap>joy
What's he going to say? ####<iemocap>frustrated
How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's dreaming of him again, walking around. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want to do?  Argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof? ####<iemocap>frustrated
To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I got an idea, but what's your story? ####<iemocap>neutral
From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why does it have to be Annie? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want a diagram. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He thinks he's coming back Chris. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead... ####<iemocap>frustrated
...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just give it some more thought. ####<iemocap>neutral
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
You have a business here.  What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Just don't think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can see that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
He was out here when it broke. ####<iemocap>neutral
Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I guess he is. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've got to say it to him. ####<iemocap>neutral
For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>neutral
So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Then it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I wanted to get this settled first. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him. ####<iemocap>neutral
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>neutral
So what.  I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Mom, what do you want?  A diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York. ####<iemocap>neutral
I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
On this, I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then help me stay here. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know that.  Then just help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He's not going to marry her. ####<iemocap>angry
It's got that about it. ####<iemocap>angry
What is going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited. ####<iemocap>angry
Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right. ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. ####<iemocap>angry
I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>angry
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look. ####<iemocap>angry
Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe. ####<iemocap>angry
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now listen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know why she waited? ####<iemocap>neutral
Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do? What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Kate. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
You're the only one who still loves his parents. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not so bad; it's a good thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay. ####<iemocap>neutral
For one thing, your mother much as told me to go. ####<iemocap>neutral
And then, you.  You've been kind of... ####<iemocap>neutral
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew they would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come? ####<iemocap>neutral
I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
No. No ####<iemocap>joy
Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time. ####<iemocap>neutral
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>neutral
You started to write me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
beating around the bush. ####<iemocap>joy
I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me. ####<iemocap>joy
Not like that you're not. ####<iemocap>joy
Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
How many? ####<iemocap>neutral
Aw, geez. ####<iemocap>sadness
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
What would I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it? ####<iemocap>neutral
You're not sorry you came. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set. ####<iemocap>neutral
I love you. Annie, I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say. ####<iemocap>joy
Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us. ####<iemocap>joy
You felt something that far back? ####<iemocap>neutral
Why didn't you let me know? ####<iemocap>joy
Give me a... ####<iemocap>joy
Give me a kiss. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy. ####<iemocap>joy
I kissed you. ####<iemocap>joy
Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here. ####<iemocap>sadness
No it's nothing like that. It's- ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't even know how to start. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Pretty much all. ####<iemocap>sadness
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know? ####<iemocap>sadness
Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them. ####<iemocap>sadness
But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just want you to know Annie. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's not your flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours. ####<iemocap>angry
How's that supposed to make me feel? ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
I'm cold. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, then let's go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Not particularly. ####<iemocap>neutral
Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh Augie ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Is that, is that-- ####<iemocap>excited
The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Whose is it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh...well. Yeah, of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year? ####<iemocap>neutral
Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket. ####<iemocap>neutral
Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait, that's my point, too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>neutral
Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever. ####<iemocap>neutral
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested. ####<iemocap>neutral
For real? ####<iemocap>neutral
God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life? ####<iemocap>neutral
And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car. ####<iemocap>neutral
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot. ####<iemocap>neutral
We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed. ####<iemocap>excited
God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this. ####<iemocap>joy
Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming. ####<iemocap>excited
It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge. ####<iemocap>excited
So what do you think? ####<iemocap>joy
About all of that, about all I was talking about. ####<iemocap>joy
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive. ####<iemocap>angry
Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever? ####<iemocap>angry
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever. ####<iemocap>angry
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You don't understand anything I am saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is. ####<iemocap>sadness
For God's sake, this is not about fish. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married. ####<iemocap>neutral
You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be. ####<iemocap>joy
dancing barefoot in the sand. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no. Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you understand what I am saying? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know you are Augie, I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  Don't you know that? ####<iemocap>neutral
You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself. ####<iemocap>sadness
So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, you bought refreshments. ####<iemocap>joy
I guess we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so, what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
About what I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
Not just me, look at all of these people. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then, what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They'll show up this time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. Of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sure.  All right.  Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Listen, do you want to dance? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want to take off your shoes? ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to get married again? ####<iemocap>joy
What?  What?  Do you want a divorce? ####<iemocap>neutral
No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you know what you get?  You get this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Maybe if you were with someone else, too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just- I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>neutral
And look what I got here. ####<iemocap>joy
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to go home?  Are you cold? ####<iemocap>neutral
Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come. ####<iemocap>neutral
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Is it them? ####<iemocap>neutral
Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>joy
We'll behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>excited
I think I shall do a curtsy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes.  Meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious. ####<iemocap>joy
Who's they? ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Elliott, worms don't pop. ####<iemocap>joy
Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Good God. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
It must be them then. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
With perfect poise. ####<iemocap>joy
It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they? ####<iemocap>joy
Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean? ####<iemocap>joy
Who knows? ####<iemocap>joy
Yes.  Yes with all of his might. ####<iemocap>excited
Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best. ####<iemocap>joy
It was a terrible thing.  I hated it. ####<iemocap>neutral
That was a rouser, wasn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>joy
And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>joy
Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch. ####<iemocap>joy
I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't be stupid. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>angry
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man. ####<iemocap>angry
No it isn't. ####<iemocap>angry
You shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes I did, quite a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Mind your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You've always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>neutral
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio. ####<iemocap>neutral
They are away in Tunis. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  Yes I am. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad. ####<iemocap>angry
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. ####<iemocap>neutral
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What about me? ####<iemocap>angry
So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll have a little, I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Really, Amanda. ####<iemocap>angry
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you going out somewhere, dear? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder. ####<iemocap>angry
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? ####<iemocap>angry
And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow. ####<iemocap>angry
I think I am not in the least bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry

Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Oh yeah, that would be.  Well, depends on what type of car you had, though too. I guess it would be worth it. helicopter. Yeah, helicopter.  There is a helipad there, right? Yeah, exactly. ####<iemocap>joy
They do it's--believe me it's huge. ####<iemocap>joy
I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and... ####<iemocap>excited
It's pretty wild. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, well I doubt [GARBAGE] ping pong [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh you mean it's not really sport that what you're saying? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's totally a sport. What are you talking about? ####<iemocap>neutral
For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time? ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah we have like away games and stuff. ####<iemocap>neutral
But you know I'm like [GARBAGE]. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to have a mustache...On the force... ####<iemocap>joy
Pull over.. ####<iemocap>joy
What he's going to say? ####<iemocap>frustrated
When? ####<iemocap>neutral
How could he see it?  I was the first one up and he was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
What was he doing here at four in the morning? ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
Cried hard? ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>sadness
What is he doing out here at that hour? ####<iemocap>frustrated
He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean a mistake? ####<iemocap>angry
What do you want to do, argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it? ####<iemocap>angry
To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you? ####<iemocap>angry
The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so-- ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, that's only your business, Chris. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm just saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you ask Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>angry
That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. ####<iemocap>angry
He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>angry
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, must you be inspired. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, I can see that. ####<iemocap>angry
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  I figured I'd just let it wait. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess he is. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I got to. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh? ####<iemocap>angry
She is not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life... ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first. ####<iemocap>sadness
So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that. ####<iemocap>angry
If that can't happen here... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, on this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then help me stay here mom. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then help me stay. ####<iemocap>sadness
I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>angry
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why did he invite her here? ####<iemocap>angry
It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden? ####<iemocap>angry
What is going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look. ####<iemocap>angry
Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, maybe he wanted see her. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her? ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh so what? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, now listen, kids... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Listen. Line. You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And how do you know why she's waited. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do?  What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Kate... ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, calm yourself. Alright. ####<iemocap>frustrated
calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you. You're shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What the hell do you want from me, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
The only one I know still love his parents. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here. ####<iemocap>sadness
For one thing your mother as much as told me to go. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of... ####<iemocap>sadness
You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here. ####<iemocap>sadness
From her point of view why else would I come? ####<iemocap>neutral
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>neutral
Everyday since. ####<iemocap>excited
Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know. ####<iemocap>excited
I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you. ####<iemocap>joy
Chris, what's the matter? ####<iemocap>sadness
No, what is it?  Is your mother? ####<iemocap>sadness
You got to tell me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Wouldn't work like this. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>sadness
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING]. Geez. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
What would I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
You're not sorry you came? ####<iemocap>joy
Why not? ####<iemocap>sadness
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
You did? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Ann, I love you.  I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
Why didn't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
why didn't you let me know? ####<iemocap>excited
I kissed you.  I kissed Annie. ####<iemocap>excited
I kissed you. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, no, it's nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things. ####<iemocap>sadness
you know over seas I was in command of the company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Pretty much all. ####<iemocap>sadness
Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. ####<iemocap>sadness
He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today... ####<iemocap>sadness
And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument... ####<iemocap>sadness
You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all... ####<iemocap>sadness
You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again... ####<iemocap>sadness
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator. ####<iemocap>sadness
'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man... ####<iemocap>sadness
And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I want you to know Annie. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm going to make a fortune for you. ####<iemocap>joy
Ugh... ####<iemocap>frustrated
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
You keep saying "my flashlight" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel? ####<iemocap>angry
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder if they can hear me talk ####<iemocap>joy
I'm cold. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's after eleven, let's go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is no point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's my point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then let's go. ####<iemocap>angry
Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes. ####<iemocap>angry
Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions. ####<iemocap>angry
We didn't see them the year before either. ####<iemocap>angry
What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it. ####<iemocap>excited
Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good. ####<iemocap>excited
Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it-- ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right? ####<iemocap>excited
Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot? ####<iemocap>excited
Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, well, yeah of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid. ####<iemocap>excited
I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's my point too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon. ####<iemocap>frustrated
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, they do. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know. ####<iemocap>excited
It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this. ####<iemocap>excited
All right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life... ####<iemocap>frustrated
And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We just weren't in a good spot though. ####<iemocap>neutral
Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it... ####<iemocap>neutral
Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way... ####<iemocap>excited
They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction... ####<iemocap>excited
They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming... ####<iemocap>excited
Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one... ####<iemocap>excited
And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here... ####<iemocap>excited
It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind. ####<iemocap>excited
It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm. ####<iemocap>excited
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
I think it's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's a PR. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They're all told the same thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Their life will start then. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry it still just fish to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever? ####<iemocap>angry
Twice is every year we've tried that's ever. ####<iemocap>angry
No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus. ####<iemocap>angry
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married. ####<iemocap>neutral
And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to. ####<iemocap>angry
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting. ####<iemocap>angry
This isn't anything like I thought anything would be. ####<iemocap>sadness
This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that Augie, I really do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that? ####<iemocap>neutral
You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death... ####<iemocap>excited
Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so?  What do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We missed them twice. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards ####<iemocap>frustrated
and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go." ####<iemocap>neutral
So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait a minute, I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh right sure, of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
You want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want to take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>neutral
What? Huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
You want to get married again? ####<iemocap>neutral
What?  What?  You want to divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, welcome to the human race. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No. ####<iemocap>angry
No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and-- ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know me neither. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too? ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Look what we got here. ####<iemocap>joy
It's not champagne. ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home? ####<iemocap>neutral
Shh... ####<iemocap>joy
If we are really quiet, the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
What we're going to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now and always sweet. ####<iemocap>joy
It had to happen sooner or later. ####<iemocap>joy
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>excited
Oh. Behave exquisitely... ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Mmm... ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, yes meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious. ####<iemocap>joy
Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too. ####<iemocap>joy
How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours? ####<iemocap>joy
Shall we always want to bicker and fight? ####<iemocap>joy
If one of us dies... ####<iemocap>joy
I think you're talking nonsense. ####<iemocap>joy
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
Cannes...mmhmm... ####<iemocap>joy
The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh... ####<iemocap>joy
Utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>joy
oh...[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh you knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>excited
Good God. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
We're okay, right darling?  Whatever happens, we're okay? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>joy
With perfect poise... ####<iemocap>joy
Ah... ####<iemocap>joy
Ah...Strange... ####<iemocap>joy
Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they? ####<iemocap>joy
Darling, don't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god? ####<iemocap>joy
You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want. ####<iemocap>joy
Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light. ####<iemocap>joy
We are figures of fun all right ####<iemocap>joy
Ahh...who knows. ####<iemocap>joy
Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Come here darling, kiss me ####<iemocap>excited
before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>joy
See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you remember that row we did have in Venice? ####<iemocap>joy
But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown. ####<iemocap>excited
I will never forget the look on his face. ####<iemocap>joy
oh... ####<iemocap>joy
We were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>joy
Presents? It was a trivial little broach. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
No, thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses. ####<iemocap>angry
Don't be stupid, what? ####<iemocap>angry
Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you? ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I did quite a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, mind you own business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy? ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
They are away in Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it on again, please. ####<iemocap>angry
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop it. No. Go away. ####<iemocap>angry
listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast. ####<iemocap>angry
I'll have a little, I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses. ####<iemocap>neutral
Really, Amanda. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are you going out somewhere dear? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder. ####<iemocap>angry
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? ####<iemocap>angry
I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too. ####<iemocap>angry
I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how. ####<iemocap>angry
I am not in the least bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots. ####<iemocap>angry
That's a very good idea I think I will. ####<iemocap>angry
Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs. ####<iemocap>angry
Well then you'll wake the people downstairs. ####<iemocap>angry
This is no time a year for Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
I will do no such thing. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. It's driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Amanda listen. Listen. ####<iemocap>angry
That's very amusing indeed. ####<iemocap>angry
You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going like this. ####<iemocap>angry
No you're not. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration. ####<iemocap>neutral
My--my original birth certificate?  But I don't carry that with me. ####<iemocap>neutral
No it doesn't say it on the form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean if I had known--I would have brought it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time.  I mean, you've seen how long it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's lunch hour. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I can give you my social-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I can give you my Social Security Number. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well.  [BREATHING] I just--I just don't.  I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I really need this done today.  As you can see, the deadline is almost up and I can't come back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then? ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that. ####<iemocap>angry
With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else. ####<iemocap>angry
Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you have a supervisor? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hi. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Well.  We still need it. ####<iemocap>neutral
um Sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, I'm sorry but I--I can't help you.  You're gonna have to go back and uh... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right.  It's the D.M.V.. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright, I don't know what to tell you right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I make an exception for you and I have to make an exception for everyone.  I mean, I-I've seen this before and I know it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do. You just have to- ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, it's-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting ####<iemocap>angry
I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know, Official documentation-- ####<iemocap>angry
No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am the supervisor.  So-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's almost time for me to go. ####<iemocap>sadness
There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know-- ####<iemocap>sadness
You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't think so. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile. ####<iemocap>sadness
You could send me pictures. ####<iemocap>sadness
Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all-- ####<iemocap>sadness
and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and-- ####<iemocap>sadness
You can just remember it for me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger. ####<iemocap>sadness
I have no choice. There's nothing I can do. ####<iemocap>sadness
What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here.  Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, come on.  You've gotta think of something.  A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart.  I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it.  I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words.  For her first steps.  I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh my God.  Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what? ####<iemocap>excited

It is good.  It's totally good.  I mean, it like oh, you know. ####<iemocap>excited

Well--can--I mean, let me know--I want- I want invitations and-- ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, yes.  This is the whole [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>excited
It'll be good.  Wow, that's great. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again.  Like-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's.  Like, I don't-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like, it just takes it out of you-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I feel so worthless. ####<iemocap>sadness
And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Or they'll never talk to me again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but ####<iemocap>frustrated
you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning. ####<iemocap>sadness
So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything? ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't ####<iemocap>neutral
No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive. ####<iemocap>neutral
There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot... ####<iemocap>neutral
...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and... ####<iemocap>neutral
... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know ####<iemocap>neutral
Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>frustrated
That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you've gotta live. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Some problems?  What is that supposed to mean? ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you lose a suitcase?  A huge suitcase? ####<iemocap>neutral
How much? ####<iemocap>neutral
Fifty dollars?  For my suitcase?  I mean, the suitcase itself was like a hundred and fifty dollar just for the suitcase, but all the things inside, all my clothes, all my personal belongings, the sentimental value, not to mention, which is more-more than all of that together. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff? ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because you don't seem to care very much, you know. ####<iemocap>angry
I didn't sign anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Isn't there anything else you can do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
There needs to be better security here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Thank you very much. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh- ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do. ####<iemocap>neutral
I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um ####<iemocap>neutral
By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the-- ####<iemocap>neutral
You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you ####<iemocap>neutral
probably even talk to-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh ####<iemocap>neutral
but Unfortunately sometimes is-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, that's--that's what I'm saying-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, Johnny died yesterday. ####<iemocap>sadness
We knew that it was coming, but-- ####<iemocap>sadness
It seemed like he had a little bit longer.  Like just last week, he was doing was so well. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just don't want him to be gone. ####<iemocap>sadness
And his whole family was there. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know ####<iemocap>sadness
He was so young, you know.  And all the stories he used to tell me about... ####<iemocap>sadness
...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna-- ####<iemocap>sadness
Nobody's ever gonna forget him. ####<iemocap>sadness
He did a lot.  But-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm gonna forget him. ####<iemocap>sadness
I won't be able to hear his voice or his-- ####<iemocap>sadness
You start to lose like that image after a while. ####<iemocap>sadness
Thanks. ####<iemocap>sadness
Hey, a what's up? ####<iemocap>neutral
Wow, that's horrible. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry to hear about that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean--I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than... ####<iemocap>neutral
.than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, exactly.  He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and ####<iemocap>neutral
And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No, you'll never forget him. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside-- ####<iemocap>neutral
That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so . ####<iemocap>neutral
It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now. ####<iemocap>neutral
I got into U.S.C. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say-- ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway. ####<iemocap>excited
So-- ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I know. ####<iemocap>excited
Absolutely. I'm so excited. ####<iemocap>excited
I know.  I know. And we'll all get to hang out.  And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like... ####<iemocap>excited
...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school ####<iemocap>excited
and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like... ####<iemocap>excited
You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C. ####<iemocap>excited
And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you... ####<iemocap>excited
...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean? ####<iemocap>excited
Like it has some prestige. so ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine-- ####<iemocap>excited
Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know-- ####<iemocap>excited
Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know ####<iemocap>excited
I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, oh totally.  It's a beautiful campus.  It's gonna be really nice.  Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls.  Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate. ####<iemocap>excited
You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first... ####<iemocap>excited
...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean? ####<iemocap>excited
So, um, so I don't know. ####<iemocap>excited
I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see. ####<iemocap>excited
I- They have like--they just have so many like prestigious like this school is top ten and like the departments within it, you know what I mean. ####<iemocap>excited
I know, I get to be one of those now--I'll like walk around and be like a U.S.C..  You know what I mean. ####<iemocap>excited
And you'll be like... ####<iemocap>excited
Student. I'm a student. Yes I am, Thank you very much. ####<iemocap>excited
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>excited
I know.  I'm excited. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>excited
That's going to be a lot of work. ####<iemocap>excited
But, it'll be fine, I mean.  I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun. ####<iemocap>excited
I know, and I mean the area's not great, but like the school makes up for it. It'll be fine. It'll be good. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. I know. So fun.  I can't wait. ####<iemocap>excited
I will. I will. Thank you. ####<iemocap>excited
Thanks. ####<iemocap>excited
So, how's it going? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, you got what?  Where? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, no way. ####<iemocap>excited
Are you gonna go? you gonna- ####<iemocap>excited
Wow, that's... ####<iemocap>excited
...that's first choice, huh? That's so awesome and now look you're gonna be--you're gonna be here. you know ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna.. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah ####<iemocap>excited
Fight on. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Wow. That's cool. ####<iemocap>excited
So... ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Right.  Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess. ####<iemocap>excited
That'll be awesome. ####<iemocap>joy
I mean because you went to the campus before, right? ####<iemocap>joy
Oh man. ####<iemocap>excited
Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>excited
You'll be like are you a fan or a student you know? Student. [LAUGHTER] Oh man, that's awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set. ####<iemocap>excited
You're getting close to the beach.  I mean geez. ####<iemocap>excited
Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, sir. ####<iemocap>neutral
I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time. ####<iemocap>neutral
I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous, ####<iemocap>neutral
um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here. ####<iemocap>neutral
Is that all right? ####<iemocap>neutral
I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end. ####<iemocap>neutral
All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So- ####<iemocap>neutral
um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely. we we ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves. ####<iemocap>neutral
So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Great.  How many seats? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like? ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that. ####<iemocap>neutral
So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare. ####<iemocap>neutral
And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again. ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, hello. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, I'm sorry.  It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and- ####<iemocap>frustrated
You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] that's good. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. So-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a ####<iemocap>neutral
--you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, it's gonna be four of them. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  And can they like all get together? ####<iemocap>neutral
Um- You know, window is nice. I guess ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know-- ####<iemocap>neutral
And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
He cried hard? ####<iemocap>sadness
What was he doing out here at that hour? ####<iemocap>sadness
What do you want to do argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can you prove it?  How can you prove it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've got an idea, but what's the story? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, that's only your business, Chris. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm just saying that-- ####<iemocap>neutral
From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does. ####<iemocap>neutral
Trouble is, you don't see enough women. ####<iemocap>sadness
You never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--give it some more thought. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
What about the business?  What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can see that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now? ####<iemocap>angry
We've got to say it to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane. ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm gonna ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not only my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's all right then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, then it isn't just my business-- ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Because it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  All right, then, Mom. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it. ####<iemocap>angry
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, on this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am thinkin' that way. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>neutral
-he's not gonna marry her. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's got that all about it. ####<iemocap>angry
Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited. ####<iemocap>frustrated
She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but... ####<iemocap>angry
But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it. ####<iemocap>angry
Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You, above all, have to believe. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just--just don't stop believing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again? ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know he's even thinking of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, so what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now, listen Kate. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know why she's waited? ####<iemocap>neutral
Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, what do you want me to do about it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But Kate-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  All right.  Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What does that mean?  Me above all? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you.  Look at you shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
from her point of view, why else would I come? ####<iemocap>sadness
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>joy
You started to write me and-- ####<iemocap>joy
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you. ####<iemocap>joy
Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed. ####<iemocap>sadness
You've gotta tell me. ####<iemocap>sadness
It wouldn't work this way. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>sadness
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, gee. ####<iemocap>sadness
You still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
What'll I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
You're not sorry you came? ####<iemocap>neutral
You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  Nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know how to start. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's after eleven, let's just go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ah, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight. ####<iemocap>excited
This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better. ####<iemocap>excited
I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it. ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think? ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, well sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember? ####<iemocap>neutral
You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket. ####<iemocap>neutral
This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now. ####<iemocap>excited
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped. ####<iemocap>excited
You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's my point too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean, ####<iemocap>excited
this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life. ####<iemocap>neutral
We weren't in a good spot. ####<iemocap>neutral
There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this. ####<iemocap>excited
all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters. ####<iemocap>excited
It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name. ####<iemocap>excited
They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death. ####<iemocap>excited
Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so what do you think? ####<iemocap>neutral
What I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married. ####<iemocap>sadness
I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork. ####<iemocap>sadness
And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that, Augie.  Really, I do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
Augie, you brought refreshments. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, then we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, so what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
What I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people. ####<iemocap>neutral
Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home. ####<iemocap>neutral
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice.  That's not ever. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, we'll see them this year. ####<iemocap>neutral
I thought you wanted to see it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky." ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait a minute.  I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance? ####<iemocap>neutral
You want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You wanna get married again? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What?  What?  You want a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish? ####<iemocap>angry
No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us ####<iemocap>sadness
'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know, me neither. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, look what we have here. ####<iemocap>joy
It's not champagne. ####<iemocap>joy
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you think it's them? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
What're we gonna do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Ah, it send shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy. ####<iemocap>joy
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. ####<iemocap>joy
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
Who's they? ####<iemocap>neutral
If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, dear, shall we like that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh? ####<iemocap>neutral
Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. ####<iemocap>joy
Elliott, worms don't pop. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you. ####<iemocap>joy
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>joy
Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. ####<iemocap>joy
It went in intermittently for days. ####<iemocap>joy
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. ####<iemocap>joy
That was the first time you ever hit me. ####<iemocap>neutral
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. ####<iemocap>joy
It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous. ####<iemocap>excited
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number. ####<iemocap>neutral
With the most perfect poise? ####<iemocap>neutral
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, darling, don't say that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love? ####<iemocap>neutral
You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want. ####<iemocap>neutral
All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths. ####<iemocap>neutral
