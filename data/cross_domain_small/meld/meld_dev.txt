Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? ####<meld>neutral
Well, the old lady died. ####<meld>sadness

Wow, thats great. ####<meld>joy
Oh, yeah! ####<meld>joy
Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign. ####<meld>neutral
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no. ####<meld>neutral
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up. ####<meld>joy

Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list. ####<meld>anger
Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, maybe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh, you lie. ####<meld>disgust
What you dont think Id go up to her? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. ####<meld>anger
You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, hold my crawler. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral

Yeah absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you. ####<meld>sadness
Oh thats all right! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, I ended up having a really good time. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness. ####<meld>joy
So what was it for anyway? ####<meld>neutral
I wanna say a disease. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>surprise

Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets? ####<meld>neutral
No! He blew us off! ####<meld>anger

I know! ####<meld>surprise
I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now. ####<meld>anger
Can I tell you something? Me too. ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him ####<meld>anger
Ooooh! Freeze him out. ####<meld>joy
Thats right! ####<meld>joy
I like it! ####<meld>joy
Doorknob? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good. ####<meld>joy
Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. ####<meld>fear
So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet. ####<meld>sadness
Its-its too soon. ####<meld>fear
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks. ####<meld>surprise
No. I think you misunderstood what ####<meld>surprise
You are so adorable. ####<meld>joy
That! Lets talk about that. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
How do you feel? ####<meld>neutral
Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so I ####<meld>neutral
And protected them from a tornado? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
I know, the babies are asleep. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, what, what happened here?! ####<meld>surprise
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself! ####<meld>joy
But my apartment! ####<meld>surprise
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. ####<meld>neutral
Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! ####<meld>neutral
When will that be? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! ####<meld>anger
Hey Ross! The babys kicking! ####<meld>joy
What?! It is?! ####<meld>surprise
Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again. ####<meld>joy
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened? ####<meld>joy
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping ####<meld>joy
A dreamless sleep. ####<meld>neutral
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! ####<meld>joy
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! ####<meld>neutral
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
When are you coming home? ####<meld>neutral
What? Guys, I'm not. ####<meld>surprise
C'mon, this is us. ####<meld>neutral
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job- ####<meld>neutral
Waitressing? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. ####<meld>neutral
I'm.. ####<meld>neutral
I, um... ####<meld>neutral
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... ####<meld>neutral
I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies. ####<meld>sadness
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then? ####<meld>neutral
So, um, will you bring the truck? ####<meld>neutral
I'll even let you ring the bell. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, my god. ####<meld>surprise
See, there you go, the cleansing works! ####<meld>joy
They're nice guys. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, they're firemen guys. ####<meld>joy
Your son. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie. ####<meld>anger
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. ####<meld>neutral
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, ####<meld>surprise
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. ####<meld>anger
I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps. ####<meld>anger
No, you don't. ####<meld>neutral
All right, that's it. I want both of you out. ####<meld>anger
Why? ####<meld>surprise
He started it! ####<meld>anger
No, you started it. ####<meld>anger
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. ####<meld>anger
Now go! ####<meld>anger
Thanks a lot. ####<meld>anger
See what you did. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, listen... ####<meld>neutral
Out ####<meld>anger
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say? ####<meld>joy
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice. ####<meld>surprise
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. ####<meld>neutral
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times. ####<meld>neutral
You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali. ####<meld>neutral
Boutros Boutros Gali. ####<meld>neutral
He says he was too. ####<meld>neutral
Interesting. ####<meld>neutral
So I was wondering.... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit. ####<meld>joy
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. ####<meld>joy
So you're a chef? ####<meld>neutral
Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant. ####<meld>joy
Oh, really. ####<meld>surprise
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I was having a conversation. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other. ####<meld>anger
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation? ####<meld>anger
That would be great. Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera! ####<meld>disgust
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. ####<meld>neutral
When did that happen to you?! ####<meld>surprise
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera! ####<meld>neutral
