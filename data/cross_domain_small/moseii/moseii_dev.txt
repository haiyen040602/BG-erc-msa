9 its like someone watched the third act of district 9 a bunch of times like lets make this into an entire movie itll be awesome and thats pretty much what they did here ####<neg><score>-1.6
I didnt really see a comparison to black hawk down until like the very very end ####<neg><score>-0.6
In fact this movie isnt even on the same level as district 9 nor is it um for uh black hawk down which people are comparing it to ####<neg><score>-1.6
The aliens are really awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
But nevertheless another really cool thing about this movie ####<pos><score>1.8
And they have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know ####<pos><score>2.4
They designed the aliens in a really cool unique way to make them like biotic but also mechanical ####<pos><score>2.4
But its not always quite explained you know like everything about the aliens ####<neg><score>-0.6
And they always like pull out something new ####<pos><score>0.5
Like enough that it actually is a good reason why they why theyre attacking ####<pos><score>1.33333333333
But they give you a good amount of information about them ####<pos><score>0.8
Uh the dialogue is terrible ####<neg><score>-2.8
And it keeps your interests in the action scenes at least during this movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Nothing in this movie is cleverly written ####<pos><score>2.2
There is no good dialogue ####<neg><score>-2.4
But it does have some adult humour ####<pos><score>0.6
Those are quote in this movie that sounded so dirty coming out ####<neg><score>-0.2
But it as great ####<pos><score>2.0
Yes um something about waffle hole am i the only one am i perverted not to think that that sounds dirty coz it totally does waffle hole ####<neg><score>-0.8
The third one was more kid humour though ####<pos><score>0.4
It didnt have that much adult humour in it ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um yeah the fourth one it does have kid humour definatelly ####<pos><score>0.4
Its a kids movie ####<neg><score>-0.2
It had me laughing out loud ####<pos><score>2.0
And i dont think that many other people were laughing about it ####<neg><score>-0.75
Which i was not excited to see ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i have to admit i i like shrek i do ####<pos><score>0.8
And it actually surprised me ####<pos><score>1.2
Um theyve become quite a bit overrated ####<neg><score>-1.33333333333
I like the first two shreks quite a bit ####<pos><score>1.0
The third one was a piece of crap ####<neg><score>-2.4
But the first two were pretty excellent ####<pos><score>2.0
Um which actually was really good ####<pos><score>1.8
And thats why i was not excited about the fourth one ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i i did enjoy it ####<pos><score>0.5
I did like the fourth one quite a bit ####<pos><score>2.0
And it just was better ####<pos><score>0.6
It reminded me of the first one had the same kind of vibe like the first one ####<pos><score>0.2
Coz the first two were great and they brought in the kids and it made it more kiddy friendly movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
Maybe its the baby ogres maybe bringing in the baby ogres really brought it down ####<neg><score>-1.8
But they were had adult humour ####<pos><score>0.8
The first two were kid movies ####<pos><score>0.25
And would go over the kids heads and this is what the fourth one kind of has ####<neg><score>-0.6
I though that adults would appreciate ####<pos><score>0.4
Because my one of my cousins doesnt like the glasses ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um yeah its its better than the third one absolutely ####<pos><score>1.6
Like i dont understand ####<neg><score>-1.4
Like i i actually felt myself checking the time cuz i was like when is this movie going to end ####<neg><score>-2.4
I do not wanna see any more of this ####<neg><score>-2.8
And i tell i couldnt get out of that movie theatre fast enough ####<neg><score>-2.8
Um yeah so we were out for most of it we were talking about i was texting i just like i had absolutely the film had no draw to me ####<neg><score>-1.8
The beginning started off great with a couple good jokes ####<pos><score>1.8
And really funny uh animation stuff it was great really funny ####<pos><score>2.6
Um and then towards the middle it was like what is going on ####<neg><score>-2.4
Um in general um the little kids seemed to like it that were in there ####<pos><score>0.8
But the adults were the adults that were actually attempting to watch it and the people who were my age as well were like what did i just see ####<neg><score>-1.2
Yes when you hear johnny depp you think uh this movie has to be good ####<pos><score>0.2
It was really boring to me ####<neg><score>-2.4
Im not going to lie to you it wasnt good ####<neg><score>-2.2
I go for like the more oldies type type films i guess like the older pixar films like toy story and all that stuff ####<neg><score>-1.0
Chuckling i mean and i dont actually go and im not being biased because i dont really go for the animated type films ####<neg><score>-1.2
Laughing you know a movies terrible when a person trying to review it doesnt even know what to say but i dont know this movie was ####<neg><score>-2.8
Um but this one was uh i dont know i mean the story was there but sigh i dont know ####<neg><score>-1.4
But it was just it was like im not gonna even lie to you guys i fell asleep around the middle of it and woke up like what just happened ####<neg><score>-2.6
Uh johnny depp doing the voice was fantastic ####<pos><score>2.6
It wasnt there ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um its one of those movies where most of the funny parts are in the commercial you know youve seen the commercial so many times that that part isnt even funny anymore and then youre wondering where the hell is the rest of it ####<neg><score>-2.2
The voice acting was phenomenal ####<pos><score>2.8
It just wasnt it di did not work for me ####<neg><score>-2.0
It was so bad i just did not enjoy it ####<neg><score>-2.8
But the the actual story line was just terrible ####<neg><score>-2.2
Im not even kidding i went with a bunch of friends and a movies supposed to be ten times better when youre with a bunch of friends ####<neg><score>-1.8
Uh i will i will actually say this right now it was a good waste of like 12 ####<pos><score>0.2
And the two others were just bored ####<neg><score>-1.8
And uh my friend next to me fell asleep ####<neg><score>-1.4
I uh jesus i dont know it was sigh its sad though because i expected so much mo ####<neg><score>-2.0
Miranda miranda was always one of the best characters ####<pos><score>1.2
And let me tell you it surpassed itself ####<pos><score>1.2
This movie isnt just bad its diabolical ####<neg><score>-1.8
It reached the new hights of horrendous ####<neg><score>-2.4
Also if youre a streight man and you voluntarily willingly goo and see this film im gonna need you to light a candle say a prayer and ask yourself some questions ####<neg><score>-1.4
First let me just say i saw quite a few guys at the cinema who clearly been dragged there by the girlfriends and to those guys i say would you like me to sew your balls back on for you ####<neg><score>-2.2
Where the problem with that lies not entirely sure ####<neg><score>-1.2
This is really just a continuation of the first film ####<neu><score>0.0
I dont know if charlotte started on made me never want to have kids or never want to have rich friends ####<neg><score>-1.4
Let me see if i can rustle up some symphaty yeah ive got nothing ####<neg><score>-2.2
And he delivers a lot of intensity ####<pos><score>1.6
He is average ####<pos><score>0.2
And its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there ####<neg><score>-1.4
Uh stormshadow is very cool ####<pos><score>2.0
His fight sequences are very neat ####<pos><score>2.0
And he really seems to be channeling michael bay in this movie ####<neu><score>0.0
And its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions ####<pos><score>0.8
The plot has the consistency of swiss cheese ####<neg><score>-1.6
I feel like it almost should have had a g rating ####<neg><score>-0.4
Sigh all in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i hate to say that ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was really kind of dumb down for us ####<neg><score>-1.4
But if you are a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much ####<neg><score>-2.2
I think you will really love this movie if you are 8 ####<pos><score>2.0
And all i can is hes a pretty average guy ####<neu><score>0.0
Because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place ####<neg><score>-1.0
Marlon wayans kind of plays a watered down version of himself from other movies ####<neg><score>-1.0
I dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
And hes pretty average too ####<neg><score>-0.6
He does some stereotypical things like talking uh about busting a cap while flying an airplane ####<pos><score>0.2
And so thats pretty entertaining ####<pos><score>1.6
The two women in this movie are particularly good looking ####<pos><score>1.4
And his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time ####<neg><score>-2.0
This is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies ####<pos><score>1.2
It was cute you know the actors did a great job bringing the smurfs to life such as joe george lopez neil patrick harris katy perry and a fourth ####<pos><score>0.8
Other than that it was a good movie ####<pos><score>1.25
But i had a few problems so i didnt love it i liked it ####<pos><score>1.25
It was a great movie and i loved it ####<pos><score>2.8
Three stars for smurfs and stay smurfy everyone ####<pos><score>0.8
But it was a good movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Only because it was very predictable very predictable ####<neg><score>-1.2
Id give it three stars ####<pos><score>1.0
That um i guess the only other problem i had with it was that um the jokes were really cheesy ####<neg><score>-1.8
But very predictable ####<neg><score>-1.5
So if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie ####<pos><score>0.6
I dont like cheesy jokes but cheesy jokes are most times funny cuz theyre really bad ####<neu><score>0.0
Beyond this age the problem i had with the movie theatre is there were kids crying the whole time and whispering xxx does baby crying get on your nerves ever if it does wouldnt recommend going to this movie cuz theres a bunch of kids or sneak into a really late showing cuz i dont think kids are going to be out that late but thats the only problem i had with it ####<neg><score>-1.4
I would definitely take 8 or younger kids to that movie its a definite family movie ####<pos><score>0.6
Although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense ####<pos><score>0.6
But its just a little weak overall for me than we were looking forward to him and he was gone quickly ####<neg><score>-1.6
Just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
He co laurence fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers shouldve known about which gives a little more of f fony feel this whole thing ####<neg><score>-2.0
It dosent give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters ####<neg><score>-2.0
In finale i would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sequal to the 87th version and only if you like the series ####<neg><score>-1.6
Nothing new is brought in those predator series no surprises no big twist no finish ####<neg><score>-2.4
Althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not ####<neg><score>-1.2
I like to tease some mystery and great plot what couldve been but than all is explained and disppeares ten minutes later its just a clear remake of predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical ####<neg><score>-1.8
You dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody ####<neg><score>-2.0
In the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalites this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly ####<neg><score>-2.2
But nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points i guess ####<pos><score>0.8
Of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them ####<neu><score>0.0
What disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time ####<neg><score>-2.0
I love my movies to be long ####<pos><score>2.0
This movie seemed um a little long ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um im passionate about movies so thats fine ####<pos><score>0.8
I dont think a movie can ever be too long um you know i like you know the dark night was you know two hours and forty five minutes you know and titanic you know all those movies a avatar all those movies that you know three hours and you know thats fine by me i love long movies ####<pos><score>1.8
Some parts just kind of dragged on you kind of you know sit in the movie theater and this is a big action movie one of the biggest movies of the summer and you kind of just wanted to you know rest your head while watched um coz some of the sequences and some of the scenes were just kind of long ####<neg><score>-2.2
But this one seemed long at some at some parts ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um the action was great you know not too much not too little just um just enough action ####<pos><score>2.0
And you just kind of like ok lets get to it we know whats gonna happen lets go ahead and do it ####<neg><score>-1.6
But pretty good script ####<pos><score>2.0
Um the story was all right ####<pos><score>0.8
I dont think it was as good as the first one obviously i i think the first movie was just fantastic ####<neg><score>-1.25
I went to this movie very very excited ####<pos><score>1.4
I think um the movies are phenomenal especially that first one ####<pos><score>2.8
Im a big transformers fan ####<pos><score>2.2
Um in interviews shia labeouf said that the second movie lacked um heart ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i dont think that this ove got as much buzz and as much um media attention and um word of mouth you know spreading around and stuff ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um after watching this movie i dont really think thats necessarily true um i think that the second movie and the third movie are very very similar um i think they tried to add a lot of heart ####<neg><score>-1.0
And he said that this new one has a lot of heart um similar to the first one ####<pos><score>1.6
Theres too much too fast i mean we basically just get introduced to this character and you know right away um this is the first movie shes in and theyre already um you know um meant to be together forever and all that good slushy stuff ####<neg><score>-2.0
And it just seems like too much too fast i mean theyre already telling each other that love each other and talking about getting wedding rings spending the rest of their lives together they live together i mean its just way too much too fast they try to built their heart into it by you know him saying you know youre the only thing that matters in this world you know i dont care about myself you know coz she thinks hes doing crazy stuff sacrifizing his life in a then he does crazy stuff to save her and hes just like i love you you know just all the sappy blah blah stuff ####<neg><score>-2.2
Um maybe im part with the second one maybe im little behind that but it was it was pretty good story ####<pos><score>0.8
He looked awesome while he did it but yeah ok so let all the girls who want all disagree with me coz they all think this is an amazing movie but they all think he was amazing because they were staring at daniel craig the whole time theyr going oh my gosh hes so hot ####<pos><score>0.8
All the guys that went were pretty much on my page they were just like wow that was stupid wow ####<neg><score>-2.6
I sat with the guys and we all try to stay awake through it um and kept falling asleep and then talk about how stupid it was ####<neg><score>-2.2
The verdict is stupid and a complete waste of money ####<neg><score>-2.6
Like i didnt expect it to be good ####<neg><score>-0.8
But it was a fun experience going ####<pos><score>2.25
Aaaaa it wasnt even holding my attention ####<neg><score>-2.8
But its just such a waste of money for them like when i see the movie thats obviously had a very big budget and it is like not even good it makes me angry coz im just like why are you wasting so much money ####<neg><score>-2.4
I honestly wanted the aliens to win ####<neg><score>-0.4
I could barely stay awake through the movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
Just there was only one character the doctor he was the only person i even really cared about ####<neg><score>-1.4
All the characters were just so unlikable ####<neg><score>-1.6
Every single cowboy was just a complete douchebag ####<neg><score>-2.6
And even he was a douchebag all of them ####<neg><score>-2.6
But he wasnt even interesting ####<neg><score>-2.0
And there was just this little boy and he was the only person who wasnt a douchebag ####<neg><score>-1.0
He was just like a plot device for this other guy to start acting like a father figure and he was just stupid but then he didnt even act like a father figure towards him ####<neg><score>-1.6
But they gave him no no character like he had no character development whatsoever ####<neg><score>-2.6
Why are you killing everyone ####<neg><score>-1.6
But he was actually complete douchebag ####<neg><score>-1.8
Whay are you killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself ####<neg><score>-1.4
It just some people were like oh hes so cool hes so awesome like youve never seen that in the movie this person who had amnesia just kills everybody even if its like but that was so unnecessary ####<neg><score>-2.2
And then maybe even when she was happy like she wouldnt frown her um frown her eyebrows but shed still be pouty but like yeah like that ####<neg><score>-1.6
It was like this like pouty like grumpy look ####<neg><score>-1.8
Like those tho those those moments in the film especially in the beginning where she would sit there stand there cross um with her arms crossed and just look out into the distance like just laughing with the same expression or shed look across the beach or shed look at her dad or shed look at her brother with the same expression and i was just like whatre you thinking i i dont understand what this characters doing ####<neg><score>-2.0
Which just uh it really annoyed me ####<neg><score>-2.6
But as an actor i really think especially an actor in the lead leading role you really should prepare for that role ####<neg><score>-2.0
Like okay shes staring whats she thinking how does she feel i had no idea like it was the same expression for shock or for sadness or what i presumed shed be sad but it sigh it really bugged me ####<neg><score>-2.4
Smacking so thats probably why she just laughinglooked the same in every single scene there was probably about two scenes that i actually thought yea she this is her acting this is good she can do this ####<neg><score>-0.4
I was like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is ####<neg><score>-1.6
But then those two moments just got ruined by the rest of an hour and a half of her being pouty ####<neg><score>-2.2
Now i am a huge huge fan of nicholas sparks ####<pos><score>2.8
Um i really enjoyed a walk to remember me and dear john ####<pos><score>2.6
Um the notebook is one of my favorite films ####<pos><score>2.4
So i went into this film having quite high expectations ####<pos><score>0.4
I really did enjoy as well wasnt too fond of the ending ####<pos><score>1.4
But on the other hand i was really um wary of going ####<neg><score>-1.4
I mean its a nicholas sparks book it must be good ####<pos><score>1.25
Straight away miley cyrus acting miley cyrus acting or lack of she had this same expression throughout the entire film ####<neg><score>-1.0
