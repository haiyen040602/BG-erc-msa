It disappointed me highly ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i was just sort of discouraged after seeing the movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
And im definatelly wish i had my money back ####<neg><score>-3.0
It couldve been so much better ####<neg><score>-1.8
Than the second sequel was really great ####<pos><score>2.2
It was boring ####<neg><score>-2.0
And not at all original in my opinion ####<neg><score>-2.2
Its not really that great ####<neg><score>-2.0
Everyone is split on this one just as they were on spiderman ####<neg><score>-0.4
And the characters just werent the same as the first two that i fell in love with them ####<neg><score>-1.2
It just kind of made me wanna really walk out of the theater ####<neg><score>-2.6
And this is the one that i can say was definatelly disappointed ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i was really hoping that this one be just as good ####<neg><score>-0.8
I love the first shrek and the second shrek ####<pos><score>2.0
I was really disappointed with that ####<neg><score>-2.2
And it just that it hadnt anything new to offer ####<neg><score>-2.2
And it offered nothing of the such ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean i went in there hoping to see something original and funny like the first two ####<neg><score>-1.8
There was a few jokes ok yeah make you giggle or something ####<pos><score>0.6
It wasnt remotly funny ####<neg><score>-0.4
But im gonna give it a two to be fair ####<neg><score>-1.2
But i still find it pointless in the end of the movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean its pleasent to the story ####<neg><score>-0.2
Nothing really that funny ####<neg><score>-1.0
But thats nothing major ####<neg><score>-0.25
The characters are all the same ####<neg><score>-1.6
Or anything original ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i loved puss in boots ####<pos><score>2.0
And not even as good as the first two movies ####<neg><score>-1.2
The donkey and puss in boots rivalry thats going on it just it wasnt as funny the third time around ####<neg><score>-1.8
And he wasnt even that great this time around ####<neg><score>-2.0
Plain and simply it was dull for me ####<neg><score>-2.0
And there was nothing new to offer ####<neg><score>-2.0
I have to agree on the negative side it was not great ####<neg><score>-1.4
And just they are with all the other sequels that are coming out an this one ####<neu><score>0.0
So the addition of this character was pretty pointless ####<neg><score>-1.8
And none of them were really that great i mean stands out in your mind ####<neg><score>-1.4
But they didnt even give him that much to do the he had only few minor lines ####<neg><score>-1.8
And theres a ne an introduction of a new character justine timberlakes character already in the film ####<neg><score>-0.2
I mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny ####<pos><score>0.4
So i definatelly suggest ####<pos><score>0.2
It wasnt even remotely good ####<neg><score>-2.8
It shouldve really be one ####<neg><score>-1.0
Well he plays that well so hes a good villain ####<pos><score>1.4
Its pretty pretty scary looking ####<neg><score>-0.8
He also has some really cool guns so that its like a desert eagle but it has to barrels to it ####<pos><score>2.2
And i who would i mean ####<pos><score>0.5
I wouldnt want that pointed at me ####<neg><score>-0.8
The action they do have is really well done ####<pos><score>1.8
Um like i said i thought the movie was great ####<pos><score>2.2
They did a good job with the fight scenes ####<pos><score>2.0
Um they did a good job with car ####<pos><score>1.6
Um but this movie it had everything humor romance action ####<pos><score>2.6
Of course um it was just it was fun it was a fun entertaining movie ####<pos><score>1.8
Uh it was good for the entire family ####<pos><score>2.0
Um definitely recommend checking seeing this uh checking this movie out ####<pos><score>1.4
Im not even sure what they were ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was just so cool ####<pos><score>2.6
Like a covered wagon horse kinda cowboy chase sequence ####<neg><score>-0.2
Oh it was so cool ####<pos><score>2.2
Uh i rated it four out of five stars ####<pos><score>1.8
Um the one thing i didnt like about this movie was they brought the main chara uh the bad character i should say in kinda late ####<neg><score>-1.5
Now rango was just fantastic ####<pos><score>2.8
Uh it was so much better than i thought it was going to be ####<pos><score>2.4
Surprised me ####<neg><score>-0.25
It had all this stereotypical traits of a western town ####<neg><score>-0.8
And this town was like from a good old western ####<pos><score>0.6
It was a great movie ####<pos><score>2.0
I dunno but it was it was cool ####<pos><score>1.6
The all the animals were just so funny ####<pos><score>2.0
And now what i loved about this movie was like the supporting characters in this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Theyre like the dumb kinda cowboys that dont know what theyre doing always asking dumb questions staying saying stupid shit ####<neg><score>-2.2
Um they all played off each other ####<pos><score>0.8
And the stuff he said was just it was just so funny ####<pos><score>2.2
And it was just oh it was hysterical ####<pos><score>2.4
All the cinematography in this movie was great ####<pos><score>2.4
And he did a wonderful job ####<pos><score>2.2
Um like this movie had great action sequences ####<pos><score>1.0
Like all the sunsets and all the landscapes of the films they just looked so realistic in every almost every scene ####<pos><score>2.4
Or nah i wouldnt say possums but prairie dogs ####<neg><score>-0.75
This aw this one really cool action sequences where like this ronny uh johnny depps posse they were getting chased by all these like possums ####<pos><score>2.2
Um everything else held up its own ####<pos><score>0.6
But that didnt really matter ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um definitely check out this movie rango uh in a theatre near you ####<pos><score>2.0
I definitely will buy it ####<neu><score>0.0
But uh it was worth the free movie passes that i used on it ####<pos><score>1.6
And thanks for listening to me ramble ####<pos><score>0.4
Uh i really enjoyed doing them for the philly d movie club so i thought oh why not ####<pos><score>1.8
Um i i liked a lot of the movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Uh rango is a really cute movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Um i pretty much will go see any movie that kind of has an interesting plot if hes in it ####<pos><score>0.6
I will admit im a big johnny depp fan ####<pos><score>1.8
I mean corpse bride hes really good in corpse bride ####<pos><score>1.6
Um its not his best ####<neg><score>-1.4
Well its a johnny depp movie so its entertaining ####<pos><score>1.4
And rango kind of falls into that ####<neu><score>0.0
Or something i would recommend ####<neg><score>-0.6
But its not something that i would go buy ####<neg><score>-0.4
Oh it has some really good references of past johnny depp films in it like while the chameleons getting bounced along the highway you run into henry s thompson ####<pos><score>2.0
Unless you have little kids to bring with you ####<pos><score>0.2
I mean johnny depps a wonderful voice actor so um he hes i do hes an incredible voice actor ####<pos><score>1.8
Uh hes super entertaining as the chameleon ####<pos><score>2.2
And be this really quirky little chameleon ####<pos><score>0.4
Like thats really the best part of the movie is listening to him uh pull off all these different voices ####<pos><score>1.8
But if you dont really have any small friends uh that sounded really perverted small children that you are related to um to take to the movies uh i wouldnt go see it by myself ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i i would yeah i would recommend it if you have little kids ####<pos><score>1.0
Okay and now its late ####<pos><score>0.4
Chuckle be forewarned low expectations ####<neg><score>-1.2
Not great ####<pos><score>0.8
Um its just not there ####<neg><score>-2.0
Sigh i really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that than the other shrek movies ####<neg><score>-1.6
But its really not wonderful ####<neg><score>-2.2
Its okay ####<pos><score>0.2
There arent a lot of kids movies out right now so ####<neu><score>0.0
Nothing to rush out and see ####<neg><score>-0.4
But lack you know very lackluster ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i guess normally shrek is for adults ####<neu><score>0.0
Save your money wait til it comes out on rental ####<neg><score>-2.0
There were a few funny lines ####<pos><score>0.6
For me it was a waste of time ####<neg><score>-2.6
The movie theatre gave me credit to a future movie so that i appreciate it ####<pos><score>1.25
But after an hour i just said enough i had to walk out ####<neg><score>-2.4
Uh if you didnt like that type of movie then i really dont think youre gonna like this at all ####<neg><score>-1.6
Uh if you like the kind of movie that ben stiller did a night at the museum then you probably would like something uh like this ####<pos><score>1.4
But uh theres definitely far better movies that you can uh go see than um tongue clicking than zookeeper ####<neg><score>-1.6
And youre better off saving your money uh and maybe renting it when it comes out on uh video so ####<neg><score>-1.6
The picture quality was really great ####<pos><score>2.0
I will even pick up this movie on bluray ####<pos><score>1.8
I will even pick up this movie on bluray um anyways um the movie for me is three starts out of five stars three solid stars ####<pos><score>2.2
Cause i had a good time ####<pos><score>1.33333333333
Um the ending is open for a sequel ####<pos><score>0.25
And uh i am looking forward to see a sequel of this movie ####<pos><score>2.0
Because i really dig this movie ####<pos><score>0.75
I really dig this movie ####<pos><score>0.8
And uh this movie i was not looking forward to see this movie ####<neg><score>-1.2
But it was really good ####<pos><score>2.2
Nine ninety screening plus i am number four you cant go wrong with that ####<pos><score>2.25
But i went and i dig this movie ####<pos><score>1.0
I was not looking forward to see this movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Plus i had a good time ####<pos><score>1.4
I was happy to see it ####<pos><score>1.8
The soundtrack is good its really good some really great songs ####<pos><score>2.4
Im wanting to talk about the good things about this movie ####<pos><score>0.4
Um anyways the music is good ####<pos><score>1.4
And the best thing about that is that all two songs um well not all of them but some of the songs are not well well connected with the scenes ####<neg><score>-1.4
I really dig the special effects of this movie ####<pos><score>2.6
Its stuttering that is a good thing ####<pos><score>1.25
Amazing special effects ####<pos><score>2.2
Like in the middle of the movie it starts with really great action sequences ####<pos><score>1.8
Its it was my favorite part of the movie ####<pos><score>0.8
And the ending was really really great too ####<pos><score>2.6
I mean the blood is like twilight with some scifi with some action and with likable characters and that that is important guys ####<pos><score>1.6
The main problem of this movie is that this movie is so cheesy ####<neg><score>-2.0
Not like the characters of of twilight ####<neu><score>0.0
The characters of i am number four are likable ####<pos><score>2.0
The likable characters make this movie a really good movie ####<pos><score>1.4
The acting is its normal its not bad its not bad at all ####<pos><score>0.4
So yeah if you want to have fun this weekend go watch it watch this movie ####<pos><score>2.4
Cause its worth it ####<pos><score>0.8
Im willing to go with friends alone with family to watch on a rainy day and if you can watch it at half price at a midnight show screening ####<pos><score>0.4
But they took a new spin on it ####<pos><score>1.4
And i just loved it ####<pos><score>2.6
And i feel like even though the fighting sequences were a little bit long in some places t ####<neg><score>-0.6
So i meant if i was wearing 3d glasses and was seeing this in 3d i wouldve enjoyed it a lot more ####<neg><score>-0.4
And just different ####<pos><score>0.2
It engages the audience more ####<pos><score>1.8
And i just really enjoyed it ####<pos><score>2.0
The green hornet did something similar ####<neu><score>0.0
And i would want the sequences to be even longer rather than shorter ####<pos><score>0.2
But i can safely assure you that even if they didnt it would still be a hit ####<pos><score>2.4
I dont know if fans of the comic would be as inclined to say the same because i dont know how much it differs from the comic or radio program that people like so much ####<neg><score>-0.2
And i loved it ####<pos><score>3.0
And i would tell you right now it was hilarious ####<pos><score>3.0
But just going into this a as an observer and someone who has no idea it was a fantastic film it was so much fun ####<pos><score>3.0
And most of you know hes a pretty funny guy ####<pos><score>1.8
It was really really funny ####<pos><score>2.8
So that doesnt surprise me ####<pos><score>0.6
And he funnied up this movie big time totally ####<pos><score>2.6
I feel like if they woudlnt have inserted the humor into this movie it wouldve been just too serious and kind of boring in a sense ####<pos><score>0.4
And the humor it was kind of necessary ####<pos><score>1.0
And the action sequences in this movie are tensed ####<pos><score>2.6
But the humor really just nailed it ####<pos><score>2.6
When they just come up with these totally completely new stylized ways of developing action sequences ####<pos><score>1.6
I love when people do this ####<pos><score>2.2
But when they figure out a new way to interpret this ####<neg><score>-0.25
Coz sure its fun to see a super hero go round and kick bad guy butt you know punch kick whatever bam ####<pos><score>0.8
That makes it more visually truly appealing ####<pos><score>1.4
And add something like an extra spark in there ####<pos><score>0.8
The acting could be better and is very medio ####<neg><score>-1.2
There is some sort of greatness to sucker punch though ####<pos><score>1.6
First the visual effects here are stellar ####<pos><score>2.6
They are unique ####<pos><score>2.8
But they you know they they bring nothing to this table ####<neg><score>-2.4
And which hurts the film drastically ####<neg><score>-2.2
Because they are interesting characters ####<pos><score>2.0
And could have interesting back stories ####<pos><score>0.8
Incredible icandy ####<pos><score>1.0
And just overall superb ####<pos><score>2.6
Browning is mediocre role ####<neg><score>-2.2
She isnt terrible ####<neg><score>-0.6
Theres never a feeling of star quality with her ####<neg><score>-1.2
Like the average horror film the uninvited ####<neu><score>0.0
But quite frankly she is implausible ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i dont know why people are hating on the film because i really do love it ####<pos><score>2.2
And visually stunning ####<pos><score>2.8
And is upstaged by many other performances in the film ####<neg><score>-0.2
Overall browning is just fails to deliver ####<neg><score>-2.4
The hits include oscar isaak as the main villain like i said blue jena malone is the soft spoken rocket and the stealing abby cornish is sweet pea a troubled and reluctant young woman in the pack ####<pos><score>0.8
The supporting cast is either hit or miss ####<neg><score>-0.2
Who doesnt have any presents or greatness at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
The misses include you know vanessa hudgens ####<neg><score>-0.4
Whos accent is so aweful ####<neg><score>-2.8
And the other horrible i mean absolutely atrocious carla gugino as doctor vera gorski ####<neg><score>-3.0
And her character is also undeveloped and weak ####<neg><score>-1.8
And whos is ridiculous ####<neg><score>-0.4
And they could have great back stories ####<neg><score>-0.2
Jon hamm and scott glenn could bring you know they could be interesting characters ####<pos><score>0.4
And the action in the movie is so well used ####<pos><score>2.8
Now let just get into two things that will possibly attract you to this film the violence and the 3d ####<pos><score>0.4
Its a joke really ####<neg><score>-2.4
The violence here is pretty bad ####<neg><score>-2.0
Viewers please resist from these two ####<neg><score>-1.5
The tire decapitation might not sound all that unique ####<neu><score>0.0
Therere about two creative scenes in here um one being in intestinal journey through the rectum in a swimming pool drain and a tire decapitation that ####<neg><score>-0.4
I mean not the sick like oh my god that was awesome ####<pos><score>1.0
But the way its pulled off its like wow that was sick ####<pos><score>2.2
Theres many different ways of saying sick nowadays ####<neg><score>-0.25
No sick in the oh my god that was crazy that kind of sick ####<neg><score>-0.8
But um yeah wow agh say that in two shee two scenes death isnt even nearly unique is a bit harsh ####<neg><score>-0.2
Its bad ####<neg><score>-3.0
Im not even gonna go to the lows to make a whole night video about this movie ####<neg><score>-1.2
Oh god this is bad ####<neg><score>-3.0
I hate it ####<neg><score>-2.8
So no now know this i am not a fan of the final destination series ####<neg><score>-2.4
But as far as im concerned this series is garbage ####<neg><score>-2.6
I might have to watch the first two again or maybe just the first one to stabilize my thoughts on the series ####<neu><score>0.0
Now i wont even talk about acting coz its just so bad ####<neg><score>-2.8
You can sense my excitement when i heard this was being released ####<neg><score>-0.5
The race stadium scene and the mall scenes in the beginning and the end where massive amounts of people die in the craziest ways are pretty good for late night buddy viewing you see you know what i mean by late night buddy viewings ####<pos><score>2.2
So it was just a little awkward ####<neg><score>-1.0
So it was just a little awkward ####<neg><score>-0.6
But um weve overcome that ####<pos><score>1.0
You know a lot of people have been talking about the expendables even though it came out such a long time agao ####<neu><score>0.0
My boyfriend got really excited when i told him we were gonna go see the expandables ####<pos><score>2.0
And than um when i went to blockbuster and i picked it up and i brought it back home he got really disappointed ####<neg><score>-1.0
I think its because it was such a moving film ####<pos><score>2.0
And i dont think he knows how to handle his emotions in that department ####<neg><score>-1.0
Theres been a lot of buzz about it lately and everyones you know a lot of controversy over it ####<neg><score>-0.4
Everyones been saying its really intense ####<pos><score>0.4
And i was unbelievably shocked how much i loved it ####<pos><score>3.0
Great dialogue ####<pos><score>2.0
It was full of action ####<pos><score>1.6
Its really just a heart warming story ####<pos><score>1.4
The characters were so great and well developed ####<pos><score>2.4
Its not that violent ####<neg><score>-0.2
Its a great movie to see over and over again your whole family can see it ####<pos><score>2.4
I really realy felt for the dad in the expendables ####<pos><score>1.0
Xxx it is a teenytiny bit violent and not enough so you can bring your 5 year old ####<neu><score>0.0
The dad was just really protective ####<pos><score>1.8
Because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a bend of outsiders and thay have all those powers ####<pos><score>1.2
Very heart warming ####<pos><score>2.2
And he made sure that hes whole family was safe ####<pos><score>1.4
Brad bird is a great writer and director ####<pos><score>2.6
Very touching ####<pos><score>2.0
It was so cute ####<pos><score>2.4
Um i think that my favorite part of the entire movie was when you find out at the end that the little baby had powers ####<pos><score>2.2
I really recommend you all see the expendables ####<pos><score>2.4
Just the great great movie ####<pos><score>3.0
There are parts that are very intense ####<neu><score>0.0
I can see that ####<pos><score>0.5
I know you guys are gonna love it ####<pos><score>2.8
So go see the expendables ####<pos><score>2.0
But for the most part it is a family friendly warm and fuzzy movievoovie ####<pos><score>1.0
It just it felt kind of cut and dry ####<neg><score>-1.4
Which would start the planning that i wish it has happened earlier in their careers ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i dont know if this scene took place fefteen twenty years ago when those guys were absolutely prime it wouldve been just um absolutely breath taking monumental moment in cinematic history ####<neg><score>-0.6
But seeing it today now when it was really nothing more than just a one xxx ship ####<neg><score>-1.2
It lost a lot of feeling ####<neg><score>-1.8
It wasnt the final you know finally happened u uniting that we all come to expect ####<pos><score>0.8
And its really what you wouldve expact ####<neg><score>-0.2
Theres little to no character development all movie ####<neg><score>-2.4
Its not a compelling narrative by any means ####<neg><score>-2.2
And really theres no humongous tale to these guys ####<neg><score>-1.2
And yet this movie is incredibly enjoyable for action fans ####<pos><score>2.2
But you know what you dont need a complecated formula for an action movie ####<neg><score>-1.0
Not a complicated story ####<neg><score>-0.4
This movie essentially was made for three reasons in my opinion ####<neg><score>-0.25
Theres a bad guy guy go take him down thats really all you need ####<neu><score>0.0
And thats you know all thats all you really needed to do ####<neg><score>-0.2
The first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film ####<pos><score>1.6
The second reason this movie was made and in my opinion the real reason it was made again its silvestre stalone telling himself i still got it ####<neg><score>-1.2
And definatelly comes through on that ####<pos><score>1.2
Hes in terrific shape for a man twice my age who looks significantly better than me ####<pos><score>2.2
Um ive got to give him credit ####<pos><score>1.0
But hey whatever and is showing yeah maybe hes not what he was twenty twenty five years ago but he still has every right to be billed as an action star ####<pos><score>1.2
Thats kind of made me feel depressed ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because you know its basically it was stalone knowing these guys arent in the shape they were twenty twenty five years ago ####<pos><score>1.2
Theres actually yeah yeah scenes triple stand off with silvestre arnold swarzeneger bruce willis and yeah actually in a way kind of fell hollow ####<neg><score>-1.0
I mean you dont see why these two people love each other ####<neg><score>-0.8
And it is very rushed ####<neg><score>-1.2
Like they have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together ####<neg><score>-1.2
Theres no character development really with these two ####<neg><score>-2.0
You dont see why they should like each other cause they dont show it in the movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Theres no reason why they should be together ####<neg><score>-2.0
And i thought this movie was gonna be really good because matt damon was in it ####<neg><score>-0.75
Like they talk for like five minutes and instantly kiss which is dumb ####<neg><score>-1.8
And i was really disappointed ####<neg><score>-2.6
But they did not execute it very well ####<neg><score>-2.2
What i liked about this movie was the concept was cool ####<pos><score>2.0
This movie is terrible for these reasons ####<neg><score>-3.0
And they left a lot of plot holes ####<neg><score>-2.0
You dont feel that these two people love each other ####<neg><score>-1.4
Number one because the love is forced ####<neg><score>-1.2
And he was still boring ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um yeah the special effects were ok ####<neu><score>0.0
Nothing thats worth going to theaters to see ####<neg><score>-2.6
And yeah i think the only character who actually showed their motivation bihind anything they did was the villain ####<neg><score>-1.8
And than cameron diaz whos supposed to be plucky i guess but shes just kinf of useless ####<neg><score>-1.8
Hi im pretty i have a giant smile im supposed to know thingsum walk of screen ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um yeah the characters didnt care weather they lived or died ####<neg><score>-2.4
Kato was the only one that was any good whatsoever ####<neg><score>-0.6
He was the only character that was slightly interesting ####<neg><score>-0.8
Who seemed to have genuine affection for other human beings ####<pos><score>0.6
Oh my gosh bad movie ####<neg><score>-2.8
I wish i werent ####<neg><score>-0.8
Really bad movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
But basically seth rogan brought none of the charm that he normally does to his roles ####<neg><score>-2.2
Because i truly love an action flick action comedy flick even better right ####<pos><score>1.6
Yeap a horrible protagonist ####<neg><score>-3.0
In fact i have to say that this was one of those obnoxious main characters ive seen a long time ####<neg><score>-2.6
And unlike other films for they kind of a narcisstic xxx boy but they bring something to the table you know ####<neg><score>-0.4
He um had all the charm of a narcissist xxx boy the whole film ####<neg><score>-2.8
Youre like oh theyre still kind of cool ####<pos><score>1.0
Theres something that just kind of makes tham so sl slightly endearing even though theyre kind of the jack ass you know ####<pos><score>0.8
Um hes just a jack ass ####<neg><score>-2.6
No no hes unfunny not funny at all ####<neg><score>-2.8
Boring ####<neg><score>-2.4
Um kato kicks ass handsome guy ####<pos><score>1.2
Just like look away what he can do he can do lots of stuff ####<neg><score>-1.4
Hes boring ####<neg><score>-2.0
You cant even tell funny jokes ####<neg><score>-1.8
What wa what hes what w why you have no skills whatsoever ####<neg><score>-2.25
I mean the only character that shows genuine care for other people be the villain ####<neg><score>-1.4
And it was kind of interesting ####<pos><score>1.2
Dont see it ####<neg><score>-1.8
Hmm yeah skip it ####<neg><score>-2.2
I liked lilo and stich ####<pos><score>2.0
I personally i liked atlantis ####<pos><score>1.6
I didnt really like ba brother bear ####<neg><score>-1.6
I didnt really i mean trasure planet was ok ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was oh i couldnt even watch it ####<neg><score>-2.4
And i hated home on the range ####<neg><score>-2.6
Oh god why did i watch that movie ####<neg><score>-2.8
I just got back from the movie theaters to go see a movie ive been waiting probably about a year and a half to two years for ####<pos><score>2.2
You know of course i was waithing for the princess and the frog ####<pos><score>1.0
If you are as big a fan of disney as i am ####<pos><score>2.5
And oh oh my gosh i was blown away ####<pos><score>2.8
I had some high exp o maybe not high expectations per se but i was definately expecting this to be a good movie ####<pos><score>0.6
It was incredible see all the different color palettes smooth hand drawn animation you know ####<pos><score>3.0
Anyway oh you can see im still speechless this movie was just beautiful ####<pos><score>2.8
So um i guess people just want to see um computer animated films from now on ####<neg><score>-0.2
They arent doing so well brother bear ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um fred dukes is the blob ####<neu><score>0.0
But in this oh my god i love you ####<pos><score>2.5
And you probably did the best portrayal of sabre tooth ever ####<pos><score>1.6
Although i do agree that the look could have been changed to fit the actual sabre tooths like with the right hair ####<neg><score>-1.0

Um its basically a um slow motion show case of different events ####<pos><score>0.4
Yeah it really is good i mean ####<pos><score>2.2
And i honestly think if we hadnt have seen watchman this would be the best credit sequence of the year ####<pos><score>2.0
The sequences of the beginning of the film which features columbus exzplaining some of his rules um to surviving a zombie apocalipse are really well done ####<pos><score>2.6
It uses um and this just doesnt apply to the um um credit se sequence on it own but appies to the movie as a whole it really knows how to use s slow motion without making it a gimmick ####<pos><score>2.0
But its a very kind of um stylistic edge on it ####<pos><score>1.6
The xxx sequence is really well done ####<pos><score>2.0
And the style of the film like the um the free streams of slow motion the um the jump cooks and all that stuff feels very kind of um tarantino ask ####<pos><score>0.2

Zombieland is a really sucessful horror comedy ####<pos><score>2.2
Um it just goes to show that you really cant trust anyone in this situation ####<neg><score>-1.0
And um while also maintains its kind of detached um satire of the genre ####<pos><score>0.4
As it contains um rea really well done and faithful homages to the zombie horror sub ganre ####<pos><score>1.6
Because um you really wanna see it for yourself ####<pos><score>1.4
But its really well done ####<pos><score>2.2

If award for the great characters of shrek in his supporting cast they are still voiced by the original stars mike myers eddie murphy cameron diaz and antonio banderas the film would be a real bust ####<neg><score>-1.2
It seems like the writers and creators took the easy way out ####<neg><score>-1.6
I give shrek forever after directed by mike mitchell a grade of b minus ####<pos><score>1.0
Unless your kids are dying to see it id wait for the dvd ####<neg><score>-1.8
Xxx whitnessing the changes and growth of the characters its usaulaly a path of discovery ####<neu><score>0.0
Dreamworks is confusing me ####<neg><score>-1.2
The last minute title that they threw on at the theaters ####<neg><score>-1.4
Everything that happened in shrek 1 2 and 3 are wiped away ####<pos><score>1.2
They solved this dilemma by removing the past within its a wonderful life twist courtecy of new betty rumpelstiltskin ####<neg><score>-0.4
But also not very original ####<neg><score>-2.0
Not a bad idea for a sequel ####<pos><score>0.8
Gone are the wickedly satirical stand ups of the world of fairy tales ####<neg><score>-0.8
Shrek 4 misses out on the magic that made the first film a real joy to view ####<pos><score>0.6
Like like even the actors were just like you know its a movie about a fucking toy ####<neg><score>-1.6
The plot is ridiculous but no one took it seriously ####<neg><score>-1.4

Um so channing tatum and marlon are transporting it they get ambushed by um i think its cobra its kinda hard to explain it ####<pos><score>0.4

Cuz its like the dude that made the technologies i i cant ruin the movie ####<pos><score>1.2
I was like you know theyre both hasbro toys theyre both moves that are com made for children ####<neu><score>0.0
The thing about this movie is like i i i wanna compare it to transformers 2 and i actually did ####<pos><score>0.8
But the thing about gi joe compared to transformers is transfomers 2 didnt know what it wanted to do ####<neg><score>-1.2
But they have a lot of adult situations in it ####<pos><score>0.4
As for gi joe was it was just like laughing its the the plot the the acting is terrible ####<neg><score>-2.8
Like in some parts you had people getting killed and the next part you had fart jokes and stupid frat humor and all that other crap ####<neg><score>-1.0
But its its like someone made you a kick ass sandwich but they put mayonnaise on it and you dont like mayonnaise and its not like tomato or lettuce where you can pick it off no its got it mayonnaise in its all over everything and now youre stuck with this kick ass sandwich that would be kick ass if it didnt have mayonnaise on it but it has mayonnaise on it or you go make another sandwich go make another sandwich ####<neg><score>-2.6
This movie is just not quite good enough ####<neg><score>-1.4
I really liked david finch ####<pos><score>1.4
I liked all the um i like the cast ####<pos><score>1.6
But dont get me wrong its not all bad ####<neg><score>-0.4
Its got my two favorite acresses in it tilda swinton and cate blanchett ####<pos><score>2.0
Like i said before is a very interesting idea ####<pos><score>1.4
And they did a lot of good things with it ####<pos><score>1.6
But and its a good story ####<pos><score>1.2
But clap huh its a pass ####<neg><score>-2.0
What whatever the name is too long ####<neg><score>-1.2
And its they looked like it had a good core ####<pos><score>0.6
Its a very interesting idea ####<pos><score>1.25
The first problem is that its all told in flashback from a point just before katrina hits new orleans ####<neg><score>-1.8
But hm it just too many problems with it ####<neg><score>-2.4
I dont need it all told in flashback ####<neg><score>-1.2
I didnt need any of that crap ####<neg><score>-2.6
It dosent it just its too much crap in here ####<neg><score>-2.2
I dont need the added element of katrina ####<neg><score>-1.8
They just need to cut that out ####<neg><score>-0.8
The the movies is too long ####<neg><score>-2.0
Th we do not need the entire span birth to death ####<neg><score>-1.6
Another thing is we dont need his entire life ####<neg><score>-1.8
And scale it down on like two hours ####<neg><score>-1.2
Just give me a nice interesting choke ####<pos><score>1.2
Um and if youre gonna do mostly cgi just make an animated movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
This also falls in to the trandy is very popular these days if you do a whole all of cgi ####<neg><score>-1.0
Makes him look too too good ####<neg><score>-0.6
This looks like it just has a polyurethane coating on it ####<neg><score>-1.0
My neighbor probably thinks im crazy yelling about movies to a camera ####<neg><score>-1.0
Now i didnt really like the first hour that much though ####<neg><score>-0.4
But i think this one did beat scream 2 ####<pos><score>1.2
I think xxx i want to see it ####<pos><score>1.6
Im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically ####<neg><score>-0.8
Im just kinda like no this is going to far ####<neg><score>-1.0
But it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent ####<neg><score>-1.0
So you better appreciate this review ####<pos><score>0.25
Theyre back to you having two killers thankfully ####<pos><score>0.8
But to any of you who are i expect a thumbs up ####<pos><score>1.4
Hmph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than scream 3 ####<pos><score>1.2
Because it does make a lot more sense having the killer be able to be everywhere if theres two of them ####<pos><score>0.5
A lot of people dont like scream 2 ####<neu><score>0.0
And actually is better than scream 2 ####<pos><score>1.6
I hated scream 3 ####<neg><score>-2.4
I think its highly underrated ####<pos><score>0.8
And later time she goes like a world war ii battlefield um castle this kind of pulled out of lord of the rings ####<neg><score>-0.2
In fact the first time she goes in it looks like a japanese temple ####<neu><score>0.0
Its kind of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the matrix films did ####<pos><score>0.2
Whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that way ####<neu><score>0.0
Although actually the best comparison this is this film would actually be something like pans labyrinth ####<neu><score>0.0
It only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed ####<neg><score>-0.4
That i got very little joy out of ####<neg><score>-2.2
But unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent unvolving and sadistic exercise ####<neg><score>-2.8
Thats pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence ####<neu><score>0.0
In fact i got mostly pain out of it ####<neg><score>-2.8
Now it also takes so really creepy xxxof the fact that emily browning in this movie looks like shes underage ####<neg><score>-1.0
When she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in the vocation that she obviously doesnt wanna be in ####<neg><score>-0.2
That kind of looks like video game in a certain way ####<neg><score>-0.4
But i dont know ####<neg><score>-0.5
So i will give it points for not being exactly like my best friends wedding even at the trailer sets it up that way ####<pos><score>1.0
And we second guess ourselves ####<neu><score>0.0
But i dont think shes leading material ####<neg><score>-2.0
Ginnifer goodwin is fun to watch ####<pos><score>1.8
If there is any silverlining in this movie its john krasinski ####<pos><score>0.6
And like i said kate hudson couldnt be more annoying here ####<neg><score>-1.2
But he has some of the funniest scenes in this movie ####<pos><score>1.6
Who i dont usually like ####<neu><score>0.0
He seems to be the only realistic character here ####<neg><score>-1.0
Its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread ####<neg><score>-2.6
Annoyingly she kind of yells and screams through the whole movie ####<neg><score>-1.25
Now the real star of something borrowed is ginnifer goodwin ####<pos><score>1.2
Um it kind of follows the path of my best friends wedding 1997 julia roberts movie except it takes thirty minutes longer to deviate from the scripts of my best friends wedding ####<neg><score>-0.4
And if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any batter ####<neg><score>-2.0
But mostly its just kate hudson being very annoying ####<neg><score>-1.6
There are some funny moments ####<pos><score>0.2
I think with with these kind of movies we kind of predict ####<pos><score>0.4
And i think its predictable up an to a point ####<neg><score>-1.0
But i kinda would have read that been like hm i mean schwarzanegger never said anything really that badass in his movies ####<neg><score>-1.0
But arite and moving on theres no character development in this movie none ####<neg><score>-2.0
Well i can tell you right now i dont remember the names of any characters none of them were memborable ####<neg><score>-2.0
And they were all just really bland and forgettable ####<neg><score>-2.0
Everything they say just sounds so fucking stupid ####<neg><score>-2.2
The only actor who can really sell their lines is erin eckart ####<neg><score>-1.0
There are moments where he says something youre like that just sounded dumb as hell ####<neg><score>-2.4
But he totally sells it ####<pos><score>1.2
The action is fucking awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
Its very reminscent of district ####<neu><score>0.0
The action is really really well directed ####<pos><score>2.6
But it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did ####<neg><score>-1.2
