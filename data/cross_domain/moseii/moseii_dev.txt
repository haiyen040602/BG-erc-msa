And finally our last point in giving a strong, confident speech, is to be conversational ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
A speech shouldn't really be a speech - it should be more of a conversation ####<pos><score>1.0
Each member of the audience should feel like they're being personally spoken to ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
Its hard - you don't know what to do ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
a lot of people, they write a beautiful speech, and they're just not sure how to communicate it ####<pos><score>2.0
So how do you give a speech that is confident, funny, debonair and charming? Well it all comes down to execution our first tip in execution - lose those notes! If i'm looking down at my paper all the time, its really hard to form a connection ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
There are so many unfamiliar and unfriendly looking faces in the crowd ####<pos><score>1.0
So lose those notes, buy instead of having a whole script that you have to get through - having a few key points that you illustrate with stories ####<pos><score>1.0
You're just not going to register as much because it doesn't seem real ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
So limit yourself to using stories, and your speech is going to be much more effectively communicated, and you're going to feel a lot more confident giving it ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
Stories are easy to retell without needing notes because you already know them ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
You want to make sure that you're looking all around at the various guests in the room ####<pos><score>1.0
Second point when you're delivering a speech is eye contact ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Try varying your gaze every few seconds to different parts of the room and that will make a huge difference in peoples ability just to interact with you and feel like they're being personally spoken to during your speech ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
You want to make a personal connection with each and every one of them ####<pos><score>2.0
So one tip we can give you is to look at the friendly faces - focus on a few key people in the audience who are smiling, who ARE engaged, and just keep alternating between them when you're looking during your speech ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
It can get a little intimidating looking into the eyes of complete strangers, especially because people tend to have their tv face on when they're watching a speech they're just deers in the headlight kind of thing ####<neu><score>0.0
