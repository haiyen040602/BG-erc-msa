Well, so we’ve got $5,000 of equity, we’ve got $1,000 of exemption, so we’ve got $4,000 of non-exempt equity. ####<neu><score>0.0
So if you take out a $4,000 loan on the car using the car as collateral, then we end up with a $5,000 car, minus the $4,000 that’s owed, leaving $1,000 of equity and $1,000 of automobile exemption so there is no non-exempt equity in the car. ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408

What follows is my interview with Bret Tuck co-owner of Edely’s Bar-b-que in Nashville Tennessee ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Lately I’ve been blogging about building a customer base from scratch ####<pos><score>1.0
Let’s listen to what Bret has to say ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Bret talks about how he defined his customer base, and then developed a product line to keep them coming back ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
So, that’s when I decided to go to culinary art school ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
After I got done with business school I sat down with my parents and told them that I actually wanted to learn a trade, versus just information on how to make money ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
I was in fine dining for a long time ####<pos><score>1.0
The reason I chose to get into a bar-restaurant or this style is because I know I can cook well ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
Then, tone it down so you can put a really good tasting meal on a plate for a decent price ####<pos><score>1.0
So I took the fine dining attitude to making stuff taste good, plate presentation and all that stuff ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
That your client or your customers are just a huge wide base ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
I think with that concept, especially with the way the American cuisine is going, I think that’s just a hit concept ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
Versus high end where quality is not the issue, , just the amount of people who are going to be able to pay for it ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
I think that’s where a lot of restaurants get into trouble is cause they shoot for either fine dining, where only this style of people will come in, or they shoot for the Subway Franchise, which that all still make money in certain ways, and they get that low income customer coming in and quality and stuff is an issue ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
This concept really hit all of them ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
I think you take those skills and you come up with a concept that really reaches the customer whether it’s a family with young kids or whether it’s a family with college kids, whether it’s college kids, 35 year olds and up, and all the way up to seniors, senior citizens ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632

If you do a Google search for that, you'll see a lot of information about that because you don't want people have access to credit cards, and so the payment card industry came up with a series of standards that people have to follow if you store credit card information on your servers. ####<neu><score>0.0
So you can start to see why having something at the application level, to be able to validate input into those web fields, becomes critically important, especially when sensitive data is involved. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
One aspect of the PCI DSS standard is that you have to have web application firewalls, because if somebody is going to that ZIP code field and they are typing in something that would give them access to the sequel database, then they would also have access to, potentially, credit card numbers that might be in that database. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
You'll often see this used to make sure that when people are inputting information into a web form that that information is correct. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
A web application firewall is looking at web conversations, and it's trying to determine based on that web conversation if the information within your packets, within that conversation, is legitimate. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816

Hair transplants are extremely effective for patients with black skin. ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632

If you were to draw down a $500,000 home loan  – and when I say $500,000, I mean in Aussie dollars, because the purchase price of the property is going to be in Australian dollars, for this example $715,000 – the lender will convert to the foreign currency that you wish. ####<neu><score>0.0
That’s obviously one of the reasons why we get asked a lot of questions about foreign currency loans for Australian Expats and Foreign Investors. ####<neu><score>0.0
Now, obviously the pro’s about it is that you’re going to get a very cheap rate compared to the Australian home loan interest rate at a fraction of the cost. ####<pos><score>1.0

The government have set up these schemes to make it affordable for students to carry on their higher education and achieve their goals and ambitions. ####<pos><score>1.0
Well Students are being asked to pay for their own tuition fees, normally at a cost of approximately £3000 per annum, funding is difficult for most people let alone students, so for a student to go to university and pay out of their own pocket can be very demanding on any savings they have or even their parents. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816

First and foremost, be willing to seek out the best in the world and work with those people ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
Again, whether they are on your team, whether they're mentors, or whether it's a group of people, seek out the best and invest at that particular level because that not only demonstrates how willing you are to get the help that you need, but, by working with the best, it also insures that you get much better results ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
The second thing that you must do is invest in what you need ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Like, be willing to say: "I can't do this alone; I don't have all the answers; I need more support" and begin allowing your own investment to circulate out because not only on the energetic level does that shift things but, again, having that help gets you better results ####<pos><score>2.3333332538604736

Max: In today's episode, we're talking about a fundamental dilemma that prevents you from making more money and growing your business ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Now, if you're having lots of dialogues lately with entrepreneurs that are striving to grow their business and what we see over and over again is this fundamental thing that's preventing you, let's say, from making more money and growing your business ####<neu><score>0.0
This is all about how you can reach more people and thrive financially ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
First, let's start with some context ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
So here's what it is ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
So, on one side of the equation you want people to value what you do for them to buy your services, to compensate you well for them, to be hungry for it, and also to really see the value of it ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Now, here's the correlation that most people don't see ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
On the other side, you have means that you need to invest in whether it's staff or mentors or technology or something else that you need in your life specifically to help you, let's say in this case, grow your business ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
They ask for favors ####<neu><score>0.0
Most of the time, when it comes to you investing in what you need, people look for deals ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
They just avoid working with the best people in the world ####<neu><score>0.0
They haggle around the price; they say things are too expensive ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Now here's where this starts to connect the dots ####<neu><score>0.0
They avoid investing at the highest possible level ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
You're wanting them to invest at the highest level ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
On the other side, you're wanting people to do that with you ####<neu><score>0.0
So, all of a sudden, there's a fundamental disconnect; a misalignment at the core of everything you are doing and that's often why people wonder: "Why aren't people investing in a way that I want them to?" So, here's two things you can do to change this dynamic not only so that it shifts energetically but so that you really become the kind of person that's walking your talk ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
You're wanting them to value your work and just say "yes" ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

In this video I'm going to talk a little bit about a problem that a lot of our prospects have been voicing to us, and this is "what has happened to their rankings, and why has it happened to them?"

So, what is it that you can do to find out what's going on behind the scenes on your website to make a big difference to allow you to regain the traffic that you once had ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
You may have heard of these updates in the past and you may have noticed that your rankings have fluctuated a lot over the last little while ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
The first one is Panda, the second one is Penguin, and the third one is Hummingbird ####<neu><score>0.0
Is the quality of the content there? Is it not there? Are all your tags and everything that you're doing appropriate? The second one is Penguin ####<neu><score>0.0
Panda addresses what's on your website ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
So even if the content and everything is perfect on your site, it may not be perfect on the site's that you are linking to and that's going to effect your rankings as well ####<neu><score>0.0
Penguin addresses how your website is linking to other sites and even what they're doing ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816

Taking out loan also helps you build up credit, which is a good thing, and get a credit score, but in general, again, most students are going to have loan and they need to kind of think about the school they're going to go to to pay back that loan, but also again it's an investment in themselves. ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632

Yes it's debt, but it's also an investment and if you realize that a student with a college degree makes a million more dollars over the span of their lifetime than a student with a high school degree, $26,000 of debt to a return of over a million extra dollars is a pretty good investment in yourself. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816

(umm) His his (stutter) mother tries to buy her off (uhh) but it's his sister Parker Posey who is (umm) completely obscene, {laughs} or not obscene, insane and obsessed (umm) by her brother who probably most frightens us (uhh) in this movie ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(uhh) I think the best line in the movie comes from Tori Spelling when she looks at Parker Posey and says no you're not insane you're just incredibly spoiled ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632

(uhh) I don't want to ruin it, but (uhh) they, let's just say that they tried to surprise the audience all of the sudden with (uhh) a kind of (uhh) (uhh) just just (stutter) new (stutter) introduction of new characters, and I thought that was fairly week and disappointing ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

You really couldn't get away from it and then you see the movie and really, really disappointing and it kind of think if it spent some money on writing instead of advertising it might have been a little bit better ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

(umm) The beginning of the film where the construction workers start to kill themselves, it's towards the very beginning of the film, (uhh) that was the first real sign of trouble, for me, was the acting by the lead construction worker ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(uhh) With Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson, (umm) Paul Giamatti, (uhh) Bryce Dallas Howard, they're all decent actors in his movies ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
(umm) I don't know if it was teaming up with Mark Wahlberg, who has is notori notoriously (stutter) wooden actor I don't know if that hurt the film, or not, but he also did not get anything out of John Leguizamo or Zooey Deschanel, who are usually pretty fine actors themselves ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So, I don't know what exactly happened here, but the acting, it feels like the words are being read off of a script ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
As you're watching the movie it looks like they're actually looking at cue cards and reading these words for the first time, that's how the delivery is ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264

By opening up the RAM from thirty-two bits to  sixty-four bits, the RAM goes from four gigabytes into the petabyte range, I mean it's just vast beyond words to describe, which means probably by next week we'll figure out a way to fill it up     but the fact is, Final Cut needs to have it's software actually recoded, rewritten to be able to support   the additional RAM that you've got. ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632

If you're a fan of dancing in that sense, just like to watch people dance, see impressive dance moves then you might want to check out this movie solely for that ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
However I must admit that the choreographed dance scenes are (uhh) quite a sight to see and they're really top notch ####<pos><score>2.0
It's kind of one of those movies where (uhh) it's stretched out to ninety minutes just to be a full length movie but it would have been perfectly fine just showing the the (stutter) choreographed (uhh) dance scenes, like a ten minute short or like something on TV, or even just like put someone put up a clip on youtube of just people dancing ####<neu><score>0.0
The actual plot, however, is formulaic and not really worth seeing ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

Hi, today I'm going to do a movie currently in theaters for view for you of a movie called ten thousand B ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) ten thousand B ####<neu><score>0.0
is about (umm) you know, it takes place in ten thousand B ####<neu><score>0.0
This movie though, this movie is absolutely awful ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
(umm) A prehistoric culture (umm) and it kind of revolves around a young man who is hunting mammoths and (umm) trying to save his tribe ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
There's all kinds of things going around that don't seem to actually make any sense,(umm) especially in regards to historical accuracy ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
I (umm) I couldn't recommend this to anybody ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
There's probably a lot of other movies playing right now that you would enjoy more than ten thousand B ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
And even for myself, I still wonder if I got the whole thing right ####<neg><score>-1.0
It's that messy ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I think it would be enough to swallow (umm) the whole scandal thing ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
And I can't, I can't (stutter) even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because it's so in-depth ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And so (umm) convoluted and messy ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
You just kind of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself (umm) in order to figure it all out ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
So it's kind of, it's all out there ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It's a little bit ridiculous with the extremist religious thing at the beginning and then the scandal and then falling in love with the girl ####<neg><score>-2.0
And it kind of doesn't really fit together ####<neg><score>-2.0
(umm) I think any one of those three things could have been it's own separate movie and it would've been a better production, rather than trying to ravel all three of these things into one long, drawn-out and ridiculous film ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
It's just not worth it ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Don't waste your time seeing it in a theater ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
Don't even waste your time renting this one ####<neg><score>-3.0
But this one was kind of fantastical and weird and out there and just not worth my time ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Again, one out of five stars ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) I I've (stutter) seen some foreign film lately that I really enjoyed ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
I really got into the story line and really felt part of these characters ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
This is Aubs eighty four and today I'm going to talk to you about the movie The Wedding Director ####<neu><score>0.0
Hey, ExpoTV ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) It's set in France and it's definitely subtitled ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) This is a foreign film ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) If you don't mind subtitles and you're into foreign films, I would still say don't get your hopes up ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So if you're not a fan of sub-titles, you're gonna want to steer clear of this one ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Honestly, I was bored out of my mind and couldn't wait for this film to be over ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
It's just, it really isn't that good ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
It it (stutter) drew on and on ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was long ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) The basic plot of the story is that this guy, Franco, is a film maker and he's worried about (uhh) getting his daughter married to this extremist religious guy who's kind of crazy ####<neu><score>0.0
But when it's, in terms of this movie it was just so pointless and didn't seem to go anywhere and was just kind of a big circle of ridiculousness actually ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
And, you know, generally I don't mind that ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) In typical foreign film fashion, it was all about character development, and all about the background story and getting to know people ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
(umm) But that would've been a better alternative to what they did here ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) If they would've broken it up I mean, then it's just different films so you can't even, it's comparing apples to oranges kind of ####<neu><score>0.0
He has to leave (umm) because he's kind of been indicted for some things ####<neu><score>0.0
So he's all whipped up about that and all of a sudden this scandal breaks loose and Franco's forced to flee his country ####<neu><score>0.0
He's not gonna be making any more movies anytime soon in his homeland ####<neg><score>-2.0
He's not looking very good ####<neg><score>-1.0
It would have took me another two or three viewings (uhh) just to to (stutter) figure this out ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) So he leaves and in his new city, he ends up being there and he meets this guy who finds out he's a film director and says, well can you film my daughter's wedding And Franco says, sure, I'll do that ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
It, it (stutter) could have been simplified or done as it's own movie where you can spend the time getting into and really explaining and delving into the whole situation ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) And that was my least favorite part about the movie was that scandal and the huge shebang that happened because of it ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) I can't think of anything (uhh) for the movie as a whole that would have increased that rating ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I'm only gonna give it a one out of five rating ####<neg><score>-3.0
I mean entertainment value here is what I want and that's not what I was given in this film at all ####<neg><score>-1.0
And I don't think any movie should be that complex or that complicated, foreign or not ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
And basically what happens is he's filming the wedding and he falls in love with this woman who's getting married ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) When you try to combine it into a whole other movie like it was done in this one, it's just to much to digest ####<neg><score>-2.0
(uhh) Not that good of a movie as I said ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(uhh) He goes off and fights crime against like this guy called the hourglass ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(uhh) It's like one of the most stupid comedies, like you don't really laugh that much, but, but (stutter) you laugh at some parts but as soon as it ends you're like, I just wasted like, ninety minutes of my life and like like (stutter) ten dollars ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
It could have been a lot better ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Don't see it in the theaters ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
(uhh) So I really don't recommend seeing it ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
(uhh) Just completely ignore like this movie ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Do not see it on dvd ####<neg><score>-1.0
Like who wants to do this ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816

What's up expo tv ####<neu><score>0.0
It's about ninety minutes long and it's rated PG-thirteen for (uhh) crude and sexual content, comic violence, drug references, language ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(uhh) Currently in theaters ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) I guess so more people can see it ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) It's from the makers of Scary Movie but this one's rated PG-thirteen ####<neu><score>0.0
I thought it was kind of bad ####<neg><score>-2.0
It it's (stutter) not as good as the original Scary Movie, and it's not as good as pretty much any spoof movie ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And (uhh) it's just like I guess like (stutter) spoof on spiderman and pretty much every other superhero (stutter) movie that's currently out ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) I guess the movie's about how (uhh) how this kid named Rick gets bitten by this dragonfly and and (stutter) he becomes known as, like the dragonfly because he gets all these like, superpowers like he gets I guess like, he gets really strong, his skin gets like tough ####<neu><score>0.0

(umm) Today I'm reviewing the movie Death Race ####<neu><score>0.0
Hello Expo TV ####<neg><score>-1.0
(uhh) It really wasn't very good ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(uhh) This means two out of five ####<neg><score>-2.0
You might recognize him from the Crank movies, where he was like a getaway driver kind of, drug runner ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) It stars Jason Statham ####<neu><score>0.0
It's about a guy that goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit ####<neu><score>0.0
Anyways, (umm) where do I start? (umm) The movie takes place in two thousand twelve ####<neg><score>-2.0
So, that's kind of the premise of the movie ####<neu><score>0.0
It's a like, for profit prison where they have this pay-per-view creation that's these death races and they have convicts racing in like cars with all kinds of crazy stuff like missiles and flamethrowers and machine guns and they kill each other and if you win, it's five races, you get your freedom ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
But he has issues and the young guy has issues and there's a lot of sex in it and it's, it's just not a movie at all that I would recommend ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
Has Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Jason (stutter) Schwartzman and (umm) the movie is rated R ####<neu><score>0.0
I am reviewing shop girl ####<neu><score>0.0
I would not recommend this movie at all {laughter} ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And it is described as a cute romantic comedy on the back ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
And so I had these expectations that this movie would be along the lines of (umm) Roxanne or (umm) You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Never Been Kissed, that kind of cute romantic comedy ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
It is based on a short novel or novella written by Steve Martin ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(umm) It's actually a little odd ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It is, to me very dark ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
A young guy that's not going anywhere and a rich older entrepreneur who's Steve Martin ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It's this girl (umm) basically is kinda torn between these two guys ####<neu><score>0.0
The premise is barely there at all ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
It's like a quarter of a movie but running the full length ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Which is bad because the actors do a good job, but that cannot save it from being an atrocious pile of junk ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
So, one out five for Traitor ####<neg><score>-2.0
And I mean, not necessarily like spy like, James Bond, but counter, like you know, investigation spy movies ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
There are so many better ones to be doing ####<neg><score>-2.0
So, I have to say, one out of five ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
This was horrible ####<neg><score>-3.0
As formality, here is my movie ticket ####<neu><score>0.0
Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Traitor, which I went and saw last night ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
So, Traitor is a movie about (uhh), it's a basic spy movie ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
And there it went ####<neu><score>0.0
But I will try to hack it together for you ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
The premise here is really not good in any way, shape, or form ####<neg><score>-3.0
And it turns out that this other sort of counter intelligence dude for the US, (uhh) is always seems to be connected to all of it ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
So, this (uhh), sort of, straight-laced FBI dude is investigating (uhh), a bunch of crazy stuff that happened ####<neu><score>0.0
That's the premise ####<neu><score>0.0
So, it's, he has to figure out what's going on and why this is happening and is person number two involved with this, and is he a good guy or a bad guy, is the people is coming to help him investigate and are they good or bad is there other interests in here ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
There's the investigation element, but that's it ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
It's a really bad spy movie cause it really feels like there's no real story to it ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
There is none ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
You know, what's the story, what's the point ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
The script was written as sort of a, sub-element ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
That's the flaw of this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
And, that's why I can't give this movie anything more than a one out of five, cause it was atrocious ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
You know, it's missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
There are so many ####<neu><score>0.0
And this isn't worth seeing at all, cause I mean, come on, you can come up with better spy movies than this ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(uhh) I wouldn't see it at the theater and I wouldn't rent it either ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
I mean I wouldn't recommend you watch it, cause it was bad enough that I watched it one time ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
(uhh) Kinda like it was a bad dream, you know ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
I'd just try to forget about it ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
But (umm) that's my opinion anyway ####<neu><score>0.0
Just forget it had ever happened ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I just returned from the theater and I saw this really really bad movie called (umm) Beer for My Horses and like I said, did I mention that it was bad? Well it was bad ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
Hi there ####<neu><score>0.0
He's a former (umm) rock singer or whatever but he's not really an actor either ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
It has Tom Skerrit in it, (uhh) that's not a reflection on him cause he's actually a good actor, it's got Toby Keith, who he's a country music singer and if you're listening to country music that's fine but he really shouldn't be acting, and it's also got (uhh) Ted Nugent ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
It's rated PG-thirteen ####<neu><score>0.0
So I mean you're you're (stutter) putting these people together to make this really bad movie and I guess that's what you're gonna get ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
The sheriff doesn't really want them to do it but they do it anyway ####<neu><score>0.0
The premise of it is there's these two deputies that are trying to do something ####<neu><score>0.0
and like I said, you watch it for yourself and see what you think ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
So they take this road trip and that's kind of how the movie goes ####<neu><score>0.0
Some Boards have provision for committee members to serve who are not full Board members, not voting members of the Board. ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Student affairs academic affairs, that's another area where you may have some non-Board members serving. ####<neu><score>0.0
So you may not have all of the skills and abilities that you need for the audit committee on your full voting Board members but you among your committee members that expertise. ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Faculty member similarly could serve that way on an academic affairs committee; great opportunity to expand the interaction between Board members, faculty and students and enrich the discussion of those committees with the kinds of perspectives that you need in committee work. ####<neu><score>0.0
For instance, we don't necessarily recommend the students serve as voting members of the Board because of conflict of interest concerns, but students could be a wonderful asset on the student affairs committee and can serve as full members of the committee and vote on proposals that will come before the Board but aren't voting as full Board members when the resolutions of the Board are passed. ####<neu><score>0.0
Don't get this movie ####<neg><score>-3.0
It's from the director of Blade, that should have told me in the first place cause Blade sucked, this sucks ####<neg><score>-3.0

It doesn't make any sense but (uhh) I don't know ####<neg><score>-2.0
It's really just a dull story line ####<neg><score>-2.0
There's like a vampire in it, an invisible guy, Captain Nemo, a guy that can't die cause he's like he starts out as a good guy and then he goes to a bad guy ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
I can't do a very (stutter) good Sean Connery voice but this was really lame movie ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
It was an excuse to get Sean Connery into a James Bondish role without being James Bond cause they didn't want to pay for that and he (stutter) shoots people and he acts like oh I'm Sean Connery {mumble} you gotta shoot people, this is how you do it ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
It's like he was really hurting for money so he picked the first script that came along ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
I mean, come on Sean, can't do you do better than that? (stutter) It's just {sigh} ####<neg><score>-2.0

It's just a horrible, stupid movie ####<neg><score>-3.0

In this episode, I'm going to tell you the difference between customer experience, customer service, and customer centricity ####<pos><score>1.0
I'm Michel Falcon, and this is episode number one ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
A question that I'm asked very frequently is, "what is the difference between customer experience, customer service, and customer centricity?" Let's start off by explaining what customer experience is: customer experience is a collection of events that your customers experience or goes through when doing business with you from beginning to end ####<neu><score>0.0
I'll see you in a moment ####<neu><score>0.0
If you want to go see a movie, the experience often goes like this ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Let's take going to the movie theaters as an example ####<neu><score>0.0
When you arrive at the theater, you purchase your ticket through an employee, or perhaps there's a self-serve option ####<pos><score>1.0
You jump online; you select the movie that you want to see at the right location, at the right time ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Then you move on perhaps to the bathroom or the concession stand, move into the theater, watch your movie, and then you leave ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
You have your ticket validated ####<neu><score>0.0
Each one of those events can also be known as a customer touch point, and the entire customer experience can also be known as a customer corridor ####<pos><score>1.0
Every single one of those events makes up the entire customer experience ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Customer service is simply an action within the entire customer experience ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Now, that employee that sold you that bag of popcorn was giving you customer service ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Customer centricity is a belief ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Organizations who are known for delivering an amazing customer experience from beginning to end ensure that their customer service at every single touch point is exceptional ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Let me give you an example ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
It is a belief that an organization operates behind the viewpoint of the customer ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
