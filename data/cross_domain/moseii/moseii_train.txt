A lot of sad parts ####<neu><score>-0.5
There is sad part ####<neg><score>-1.2
And its a really funny ####<pos><score>1.8
But it was really really awesome ####<pos><score>2.2
Anyhow it was really good ####<pos><score>2.4
I mean they did a little bit of it ####<neg><score>-1.0
Thay did they didnt really do a whole bunch of background info on why she has to fight and be prepared ####<neg><score>-0.8
And they shouldve i guess ####<neu><score>0.0
But not a whole bunch ####<neg><score>-1.75
And xxx but besides that it was all over pretty good ####<pos><score>0.8
They shouldve live up with more ####<neu><score>0.0
Oh my god a lot of action ####<pos><score>0.2
And there is like someone while someone there was a lot of action ####<neu><score>0.0
I mean that was impressive ####<pos><score>2.6
I liked that scene where he had a swords in there and theres bunch of people that are gonna shoot him boom boom boom boom take him down take him down bam bam bam bam bam take that with my magical swords ####<pos><score>2.2
Ok but the two big character appearances in this movie are easily deadpool and gambit ####<pos><score>0.6
Actually i liked him a lot ####<pos><score>2.0
And i thought he made a good actor for the dead poor character ####<pos><score>1.8
Now hes seen at the beginning that really sold me ####<pos><score>2.6
Now the title of the movie basically says it all ####<neg><score>-0.4
My reason im a comic book fan ####<neg><score>-0.2
Now im not even gonna sugar coat this this movie frustrated me to such an extreme extent that i was loudly exclaiming why at the end of the film ####<neg><score>-2.8
That huh before we go on with that i must say that this had a surprisingly decent cast ####<pos><score>0.8
That like to see comic book characters treated responsibly ####<neg><score>-1.4
Now hugh jackman was always the best choice to play wolverine i will admit that ####<pos><score>1.8
Strange since one of my biggest grapes with the xman series was and always is the xxx ####<neg><score>-1.4
You know nothing great ####<neg><score>-1.0
And in my opinion he carried the movie fine ####<pos><score>0.8
Hes a star of the movie ####<pos><score>0.4
But you know he did it ####<neg><score>-0.6
He carried it ####<pos><score>1.25
Nothing special ####<neg><score>-0.8
But its pretty selfexplanatory ####<neu><score>0.0
Which is a smart move since you know you have to be real comic book fan to get what hes name is supposed to be ####<pos><score>1.4
And he almost looks exactly the same as this character in defiance ####<pos><score>0.2
Um i actually think that liev schreiber is a good actor ####<pos><score>0.6
Now other performances are borderline ####<neg><score>-0.4
I mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something ####<neg><score>-2.0
But for me i was just a little bored ####<neg><score>-1.8
Kids are gonna love the film ####<pos><score>2.6
But otherwise i dont know ####<neg><score>-1.25
Sure there were cute money parts in the mixting of the film ####<pos><score>0.4
I didnt even care for it ####<neg><score>-2.0
But for this one i just didnt feel like it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Because it had a real nostalgic feel to it ####<pos><score>1.0
Um i loved the very first alvin and the chipmunks movie ####<pos><score>1.6
But you know for this one i just didnt care ####<neg><score>-1.8
It reminded me of getting up on a saturday morning and eating fruit loops and um watching cartoons ####<pos><score>2.0
And um while the trailer made the film look real nice and cute ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um i saw no reason why they needed to bring back the villain from the first one ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um im sure kids are gonna love it ####<pos><score>2.2
It was just flat ####<neg><score>-1.8
And you knew you shouldnt be laughing ####<neg><score>-1.0
My favorite scene would definately be the volturi ####<pos><score>2.0
Um then my wins on screen wiskers i mean they were really worn in a lots which is a shame because i thought xxx really rather good ####<neg><score>-0.6
And um michael sheen as aro as well he was rather enjoyable to watch ####<pos><score>1.8
And the script it left all the key plots and emotion from the characters to be exposed through dialogue ####<pos><score>0.4
I think it was empire magazines review of new moon that said that kristen relied heavily on the tactic of tactic of blinking a lot which she really does do a lot ####<neg><score>-0.4
But at the same goes for rob pattinson as edward and taylor lautner as jacob they do a lot of frowning im a manly man and i frown ####<neg><score>-0.2
For the moment in this the whole cinema was laughting ####<pos><score>1.8
And i think the volturi that was my exciting bit of the entire film ####<pos><score>1.2
The rest of the film was just watching kristen just mob around ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i thought they were average ####<neg><score>-0.4
I thought twilight directed by catherine hardwicke was actually really rather enjoyable ####<pos><score>2.0
Lets face it they are really not master pieces ####<neg><score>-1.75
But cinematicly i thought it was good quite good ####<pos><score>2.2
Um i mean obviously it had its flaws ####<neg><score>-1.2
I wasnt thinking on hearing that chris weitz was gonna start the new moon because of the destruction that was phillip pullman the golden compass ####<neg><score>-0.6
It wasit was enjoyable ####<pos><score>1.6
And i i didint really know what to expect from new moon um in terms of his direction ####<neg><score>-0.2
I thought that film was awful ####<neg><score>-2.4
The thing is its a very good translation of the book ####<pos><score>2.2
Overall new moon was it was ok just average ####<pos><score>0.6
And i really appreciate that loyalty ####<pos><score>1.4
Its very very loyal to the book ####<pos><score>1.6
And the book is not necessarily the most thrilling book ever ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um however it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws ####<neg><score>-0.2
It wasnt really the best the most thrilling read ever ill say that ####<neg><score>-1.4
I mean the entire xxx is bella swan kristen kristens stewards character mobbing around completely depressed ####<neg><score>-1.4
The angsty too angsty moments withdrawn out to the max as far as thay can go ####<neg><score>-1.0
So overallnew moon even with the bigger better budgets huh it was still too long ####<neg><score>-1.8
And that was really boring ####<neg><score>-1.6
Like a movie called cowboys and aliens a lot of people would think would be kind of like crazy ####<neg><score>-0.4
I just thought it was kind of stupid ####<neg><score>-2.0
So you can care about him ####<neu><score>0.0
There are some flaws here ####<neg><score>-1.0
And alsoum olivia wild shes pretty good ####<pos><score>2.0
And im gonna give it an eight out of ten ####<pos><score>2.2
It was really fun ####<pos><score>1.4
A very good time ####<pos><score>2.2
And i definately recommend you check it out in theaters ####<pos><score>2.2
And there but theyre not huge glaring flaws ####<neg><score>-0.6
But i was kind of expecting that ####<neu><score>0.0
I wasnt a huge fan of it ####<neg><score>-1.0
And also i like how its kind of upfront to show them to us instead of hiding them like showing a little like an arm on scene or something no they just straight up show it to us ####<pos><score>1.6
And i really enjoyed that ####<pos><score>1.8
I it was really cool when they did that ####<pos><score>1.8
Coz the aliens were really cool looking ####<pos><score>1.8
They are huge ####<pos><score>1.0
Theyre really strong ####<pos><score>0.8
And theyre kind of scary looking ####<neg><score>-0.8
I didnt expect that ####<neu><score>0.0
Shes actually pretty good ####<pos><score>1.4
Shes in everything nowadays ####<neu><score>0.0
Shes beautiful ####<pos><score>0.2
And shes not a bad actor ####<pos><score>0.2
Daniel craig does a very good job here ####<pos><score>2.4
He kind of channels the man with no name clint eastwood ####<pos><score>0.6
But he becomes more likeable ####<pos><score>0.6
His guts developed more as more likeable character ####<pos><score>0.6
Much say that i really enjoyed cowboys and aliens ####<pos><score>2.0
You guys dont know what youre gonna go and see when you go walk into the movie called cowboys and aliens ####<neu><score>0.0
There was a lot of fun ####<pos><score>0.4
The only oscar that i can even thing of is maybe like best cinematography ####<neu><score>0.0
If youre expecting some artsy serious oscar contender than youre wrong ####<neg><score>-0.4
And maybe best visual effects ####<pos><score>1.6
Because the cinematography in this movie is great ####<pos><score>2.4
But again you you cant expect a huge like surreal mind bender from the movie called cowboys and aliens yo ####<neg><score>-0.4
Coz the visual effects are pretty cool ####<pos><score>1.8
Such as sometimes the aliens in the western setting do look a little goofy ####<neg><score>-0.6
At first hes just kind of like grumpy old guy ####<neg><score>-0.6
Hes he gives an entertaining performance as the kind of like the leader the of the town ####<pos><score>1.0
Overall i really enjoyed cowboys and aliens ####<pos><score>2.0
Not a huge flaw but its there and its noticable ####<neg><score>-1.4
The action is really intense which surprised me ####<pos><score>2.2
And its satisfactory ####<pos><score>0.8
Theres some really intense action scenes especially the scene when the aliens first invade ####<pos><score>2.0
I didnt expect the action to be so intense ####<pos><score>1.2
It gave me chills ####<pos><score>0.5
That scene is like crazy ####<pos><score>0.2
The action is really cool ####<pos><score>2.6
I its a lot of fun ####<pos><score>2.0
One thing i like with the aliens is that a they are not just weak links that hide behind the technology ####<pos><score>1.4
The aliens are really cool ####<pos><score>2.2
I think he does a great job at what he does ####<pos><score>2.0
And a lot of people have been saying that ####<neg><score>-0.2
Harrison ford is also good ####<pos><score>1.4
Also his innocent accent is pretty convincing ####<pos><score>1.2
And he does a really good job ####<pos><score>2.2
He doesnt take crap from anybody ####<pos><score>0.6
Is really really hard core ####<pos><score>1.2
And sometimes it kind of veers into cliche action movie territory ####<neg><score>-1.0
Hes a really bad ass ####<pos><score>2.2
But sometimes it just veers entirely cliche action movie territory again ####<neg><score>-1.6
But they are noticable flaws ####<neg><score>-1.8
But then you kind of like walk out of the movie and youre like well i i get what happened i understand what happened ####<neg><score>-1.0
But what what would you do for green lantern movie 2 that would be even like worth while now ####<neg><score>-0.8
Because i mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how youre supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or or destroy him at the same time ####<neu><score>0.0
And it does kind of a lea helps alleviate what that whole was is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking ####<pos><score>1.4
But i think there was also some sort of like um tone within the actual um powers of the green lantern and himself and that you can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life ####<pos><score>0.8
And i think having this sort of superpower almost this power to just imagine anything kind of just um helped me get passed that you know these are all cgi characters and set ####<pos><score>1.0
This is a playground and their imaginary playground and anything can happen anything that what also made the film exciting ####<pos><score>2.2
Because you dont entirely know whats coming next ####<pos><score>0.2
So its kind of interesting to see um where theyre gonna be going with that ####<pos><score>1.6
Im looking forward to it ive got to say ####<pos><score>2.0
Before i went in to see the green lantern ive been hearing all these like critics basically just trashing this movie left and right ####<neg><score>-0.5
I enjoyed it for what it was you know ####<pos><score>1.4
But i at the same time i do wanna just say that i enjoyed this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
This is a movie that youre gonna go out and see ####<pos><score>2.0
Its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for this summer time you know ####<pos><score>2.2
Because i i would actually say this probably is one of the first movies this year that ive seen this year that you wanna see in 3d especially for just the opening portion ####<pos><score>2.4
And you wanna see it in 3d ####<pos><score>2.0
And the rest of it does look good as well ####<pos><score>1.4
It looks really good ####<pos><score>1.8
Its not like a dark movie or anything ####<pos><score>0.2
And i just had fun watching this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
So its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just wanna see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff ####<pos><score>2.2
Its very much a light hearted ####<pos><score>1.2
Because it looks like a cartoon ####<neg><score>-1.5
And you know going into it or these watching the trailers before head i was really kind of hesitant about seeing the green lantern in the first place ####<neg><score>-1.0
Because i think why not just make this you know movie this live action movie and talk cartoon ####<neg><score>-0.6
Im not really a huge fan of having like all these 3d characters ####<neg><score>-1.6
And it seemed like they were gonna go that route ####<neu><score>0.0
Thats really the route that youre gonna go ####<pos><score>0.333333333333
Its not like the green lantern is the next batman begins or or the dark nighter ####<neg><score>-0.4
Yeap absolutely not to be missed ####<pos><score>2.4
Its extremly well made ####<pos><score>2.8
Its extremly dare i say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way ####<pos><score>2.0
Its extremly dare i say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way and even now its a horror film ####<pos><score>1.6
Its definately got some fun kevin smith moments in it for you to laugh with um ####<pos><score>1.8
Probably one of the ballsiest probably one of the ballsiest fims od sundance 2011 ####<pos><score>2.0
Its bold ####<pos><score>0.8
Um as really the best way to describe this film is its big ####<pos><score>1.4
It makes big powerfuls statements ####<pos><score>2.0
Its strong ####<pos><score>0.4
Everything from the way its being released to the performances and to the story itself is absolutely ovrt the top impressive ####<pos><score>2.2
It doesnt hold back ####<pos><score>0.5
Its a huge break through for kevin smith ####<pos><score>2.4
And really well done ####<pos><score>2.6
John goodman absolutely amazing ####<pos><score>2.6
Its completely different from anything weve ever seen him do before ####<pos><score>0.4
Its so well done ####<pos><score>2.6
Melissa leo will have you creeped out to your inner core with her tiny little smile ####<pos><score>0.8
Its a horror film ia a true sense ####<pos><score>0.25
For all of those people who are hating on it i dont know what they are complaining about it ####<pos><score>1.8
Um it is it is definately one of those films thats not gonna be easy for you to find ####<pos><score>0.2
And it is absolutely horrifying ####<neg><score>-2.0
Whenever it comes to your town do not miss it ####<pos><score>2.8
Its being released in a very interesting way ####<pos><score>1.2
And i think i why i would be scared is because i would feel scared and kind of sad if i lost my own mother ####<neg><score>-1.2
I am eight years old and i thought it was really s kind of scary ####<pos><score>0.6
But it all turns out great in the end ####<pos><score>2.4
I just got finished watching an excellent movie called mars needs moms ####<pos><score>3.0
I liked gribble because he helped milo get milos mother away from the alians ####<pos><score>1.8
And my favorite characters in the movie would have to be milo milos mother and gribble ####<pos><score>2.0
And my favorite part in the movie was when milo has to save gribble ####<pos><score>2.2
Which i thought was awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
Because it is a good movie ####<pos><score>2.2
And i would recommend this movie for ages 3 and up ####<pos><score>2.0
Like for example my brother is five years old and he didnt think this movie was scary at all ####<neg><score>-0.4
And it depends what age you are and how you to how you feel like see the movie ####<pos><score>0.8
Beacuse i wanted to see how they could frame that ####<pos><score>0.25
Um that was probably part of the trailer that got me to go and see the movie ####<pos><score>0.4
Its a great one ####<pos><score>2.2
So um if you havent seen winnie the pooh and you like family films go see it ####<pos><score>1.8
I definately recommend it ####<pos><score>2.2
And so i was kind of curious to see maybe if that was what disney was going for and it definately was what thay were going for ####<pos><score>1.6
Um its its great if you remember that was old films ####<pos><score>2.0
But i bet if you put them next to the new film that the style would be similar enough that you wouldnt be able to really tell what the difference is ####<pos><score>0.6
The story is pretty simple ####<neu><score>0.0
Would be great for kids too ####<pos><score>2.0
Um funny jokes that the kids would get ####<pos><score>0.8
Weve got great jokes ####<pos><score>1.6
Because he says issue and they think he is saying at you ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um i love the scene where eeyore and pooh think that owl is getting sick ####<pos><score>2.0
And but xxx were too hollywood for me ####<neg><score>-1.2
The numbers they and they kind of stuck to the book of it so i like that ####<pos><score>1.4
Because think about it if you if your top priority is survival than why would you be worried about having the latest technology you know what i mean ####<neg><score>-0.6
Like th this thing isnt really a big deal but um i i ddint like the fact that john had an iphone ####<neg><score>-1.2
But my opinin like he shouldnt have an iphone he shouldnt care about the latest trends so thats really what the lieutenant xxx ####<neg><score>-1.6
So since were not really sure what their financial situation is they could be like scraping by or they could be totally rich ####<neu><score>0.0
Um like i said it wasnt big deal ####<neg><score>-0.4
I thought it was all too commercial in that aspect ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um another thing that did bother me were the kissings ####<neg><score>-1.2
And you probably dont think so but you know just one of those little things that that hurt you for some reason you know what i mean ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um so there are things that i liked about the movie better than i liked about the book and vice verse ####<pos><score>1.0
Maybe because number four was not my all time favorite book ####<neg><score>-0.8
It wasnt like it wasnt like oh the book was so much harder than movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
But but um i wasnt crazy about it ####<neg><score>-0.8
It was a good book ####<pos><score>1.6
So i liked the movie ####<pos><score>1.4
So yeah and the movie was pretty good in my opinion ####<pos><score>1.8
Good job of explaining thing with lorain the mogadorians ####<pos><score>0.5
Because it did a good job of explaining the back story in the book ####<pos><score>1.8
Um he was awesome ####<pos><score>2.4
Like he was incredible ####<pos><score>2.6
The other guy that did a really good job was um jeffrey dean morgan ####<pos><score>1.8
He did a very good job ####<pos><score>2.0
Ill tell you who made the movie ####<pos><score>0.8
Who was just kick ass 100 of time was the guy that played our rorschach ####<pos><score>1.8
But anyways he was awesome ####<pos><score>2.6
I thought that was very cool ####<pos><score>2.4
Very dark ####<neg><score>-1.25
Um i really liked sicko guy ####<neg><score>-1.5
Um graphics were incredible ####<pos><score>1.8
Some really sucky acting ####<neg><score>-2.6
Um some really good acting ####<pos><score>2.2
Coz people were like eating popcorn and you see the first show and people you hear like this this ripple effect of whispering oh my god is that a is that am i looking at this right what ####<pos><score>1.0
So this was pretty funny ####<pos><score>1.4
Um there couldve been less blue nudity ####<neg><score>-1.6
I thought that was really funny ####<pos><score>1.6
It was funny though ####<pos><score>1.8
Because what was weird was the fact that in part of the movie hes wearing like a blue um overall flong thing medal flong thing so i was like why not wear the whole whole time you know why why you got to go command on us ####<neg><score>-1.2
But um you know overall it was good ####<pos><score>1.8
Um so at the end theres not really a whole lot of redeeming value that i think you come up with ####<neg><score>-1.8
Its kind of weird ####<neg><score>-1.0
Hes funny ####<pos><score>2.0
All right so enough of the nudity ####<neg><score>-1.6
I dont know classic superhero kind of getting on kind of thing ####<pos><score>0.6
Um junior lady girl i know i i mean she looked fan fantastic ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um but what sucked what was bad was malin akerman the girl who plays the silk spectre ii ####<neg><score>-2.2
She looked like a superhero ####<pos><score>0.8
She looked phenomenal ####<pos><score>2.2
And theres a vast difference between those two things ####<neg><score>-0.2
But she acted like power ranger ####<neg><score>-0.4
I was very impressed ####<pos><score>2.2
But um he did a really good job at acting ####<pos><score>2.2
And it seemed like everything was sort of overwhelmingly bad ####<neg><score>-1.6
And um theres not in my opinion there wasnt very much of a balance between sort of like the good evil kind of thing ####<neg><score>-1.6
I warn you its a very very dark ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um but its extremely dark ####<neg><score>-0.6
And its very very interesting ####<pos><score>1.4
So overall its its like a blend of youve got alternative history ####<pos><score>0.6
Overall overall it had far too many plot holes ####<neg><score>-1.8
And just not enough depth to be interesting ####<neg><score>-2.2
I have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character thompson ####<pos><score>2.0
But hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life he stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them ####<neg><score>-1.0
Which is where all great relationships should start ####<pos><score>0.4
I literally said out loud what que what is this movie that i am seeing what is this ####<neg><score>-2.4
And just its very its very chaotic at the end of this movie ####<neg><score>-1.0
But theres a reason for that theres a reason for why i was confused ####<neg><score>-0.2
I do not understand this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
Thanks a lot commercial ####<neg><score>-1.4
First off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thought provoking than inception ####<neg><score>-2.6
But i must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so i thought maybe it has a chance ####<pos><score>0.4
The entire time i was constantly comparing it to inception ####<neg><score>-0.2
I was just waiting for joseph gordon levitt to come out just jump out any time and say its a paradox ####<neg><score>-0.5
I i should give it a shot you know ####<pos><score>0.6
Which kind of just ruins the suspense right there because if youve got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustement bureau and this is what we do you know its just kind of ruins the suspense ####<neg><score>-2.2
Now the only suspensful part that i found in the first thirty minutes of the movie was when matt damon first discovers the bureau in the first place ####<neg><score>-0.8
Interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller ####<neu><score>0.0
And now im not im not excited anymore ####<neg><score>-1.4
You know it was it was funny at times ####<pos><score>1.0
Um you know it had some interesting writing ####<pos><score>0.6
But just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the suspensful parts ####<neg><score>-2.2
Matt damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy ####<pos><score>1.4
But he actually found um when hes seen come up it slowed the movie down um and this is the problem um with predator to predators compared to predator ####<neg><score>-1.4
Predator is really well paced movie ####<pos><score>1.8
And it picks up speed and never lets go ev even in the same xxx where they they slow you know they meant to have some dialogue and and talk about whats going on yo you know ####<pos><score>1.0
It felt the movie slowed down wheres it in the middle of this ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um he had some funny he had a few one lines that was quite quite funny ####<pos><score>1.2
Yeah once unfortunately um i think in the writing somewhere they they just werent um developed enough fear to care about them um and that includes is it topher graces i think i think his name was includs his character um ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um i just didnt think it was well developed enough and um i also i i include in that laurence fishburnes character as well ####<neg><score>-1.0
Who i think rodrigez when he wrote the mo wrote the movie was going for a marlon brando apocalipse now type of character ####<neg><score>-0.4
When when they they with um laurence fishburne character it does slow down a great deal ####<neg><score>-0.8
I didnt really feel um the inclusion of his charater was necessary ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um im gonna give the reasons why i like him ####<pos><score>1.2
Um which i think rodrigez was going for he th th he always said that he was gonna do the sequel um he wanted this to be um th the predator equivalent of aliens ####<neg><score>-0.2
But mostly im gonna give the reasons of why i dont think hes gonna be a classic in the same way as the first movie predator or aliens ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um and im gonna really point out why that i dont think he really pulled he pulled that off ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um as um you know as aliens was to alien ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um but i did enjoy it ####<pos><score>0.2
Um why was a mistake really to try and do that ####<neg><score>-1.5
The characters were well developed um not all of the characters ####<pos><score>1.4
So um im gonna point out the stuff i did like there were some action scenes in it ####<pos><score>1.2
Um i i liked agent brodys character ####<pos><score>1.6
But um i would say that um there was theres good there were four good characters in there ####<pos><score>0.6
You know well drawn out character ####<pos><score>1.4
I thought he was um well developed ####<pos><score>1.6
I liked the girl who was the israeli sniper ####<pos><score>0.8
Someone you cared about ####<neu><score>0.0
Um i liked the russian guy juri ####<pos><score>1.0
I thought she was the number one well drawn character ####<pos><score>1.2
And xxx was an interesting character ####<pos><score>1.6
Um you cared you there was enough in there for you to care about him ####<pos><score>0.6
Um it couldve been written out ####<neg><score>-0.8
I mean this movie makes um makes um star wars pretty close ####<neu><score>0.0
I mean its its about that level star war is ####<pos><score>0.2
Pretty close as far as just cgi heavy like this time its what its like human face and everything around that face is cartoon cgi computer effects ####<neg><score>-1.2
And thats because about half way through the movie i realized that this is just its really just a cartoon ####<neg><score>-0.8
If you look at it as a live action movie you youre gonna be disappointed ####<neg><score>-2.0
But if you look at it as a cartoon which is pretty much mostly is with all the cgi fx ####<neg><score>-1.0
And and there is a lot of it ####<neg><score>-0.333333333333
And um i have to admit i was watching this i purposly put it on because i figured it would be something that would be stupid that i could fall asleep in the middle of and not miss too much ####<neg><score>-1.4
So i didnt didnt have very high expectations for this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
Just wanted something to watch while i was falling asleep ####<neg><score>-0.4
Because i three major complaints i have about this movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i um pretty much it pretty much met my low expectations for the most part ####<neg><score>-1.4
And um the story was pretty weird ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um biggest one is the cgi effects were just terrible ####<neg><score>-2.6
And might have been it might have made more sense ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um and again i i if i had to pay closer attention i might have followed it more ####<neg><score>-0.8
Which i mean for a movie about ji joe ninty minutes is enough ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um um this movie this movie um by half way through i was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long ####<neg><score>-2.2
But thats just me ####<neg><score>-0.333333333333
Ok i dont need a three hour mini xxx about ji joe ####<neg><score>-2.0
And the last big thing was um just the the it it i know its about jijoe you know obviously its gonna be about the army but it just felt like um like um military propaganda kind of like you know ####<neg><score>-1.6
I thought that two hours was way too long for this movie ####<neg><score>-1.8
Of course its too much ####<neg><score>-0.666666666667
It fell like i was watching one of those army of one commercials sometimes ####<neg><score>-1.0
I i guess um but the funny thing is um i mean funny thing is despite as despite everything bad about this movie i ended up half way liking it ####<pos><score>0.6
Of course its gonna be making them look good just fine ####<pos><score>0.6
And i i always think thats hilarious ####<pos><score>1.2
But what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humour jabs ####<pos><score>2.0
I thought it was really cool ####<pos><score>2.4
That was a great effect ####<pos><score>1.2
There was a lot of cheap child humour ####<neg><score>-0.8
Which everyone can relate to ####<pos><score>1.2
This movie is adorable ####<pos><score>2.2
There were some really good things about this movie ####<pos><score>2.0
This movie is just too adorable ####<pos><score>2.4
The visuals were great ####<pos><score>1.8
The voice acting excellent ####<pos><score>2.8
Toy story had elements of it but this movie played with 3d and um different ways to come at you out of the screen ####<pos><score>2.2
This was probably the best 3d movie ive seen in a long time coz it actually used 3d ####<pos><score>2.8
The voice acting in this was incredible ####<pos><score>2.6
So i liked that a lot ####<pos><score>2.2
Of i couldnt i couldnt even believe it was russell brand ####<pos><score>0.8
Steve carell voices gru and russell brand actually really impressed me with his old man voice for the doctor ####<pos><score>1.8
And there was maybe one time when i thought i actually heard russell brand himself ####<neg><score>-0.25
I kept i was listening bored ####<pos><score>0.2
As for 3d i say yes ####<pos><score>1.0
But otherwise i thought he was excellent ####<pos><score>1.8
And some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks ####<pos><score>0.5
Theres one scene in this movie that makes 3d entirely worth it ####<pos><score>2.4
I mean my stomach was almost going wohu as we went down the big drop ####<pos><score>0.6
But theres a roller coaster scene and if you are um get a little bit motion sick you might not wanna see it in 3d because youll feel like youre on this coaster ####<pos><score>0.6
And you dont exactly know whats going on ####<neg><score>-1.0
And i think early on the twist is revealed ####<neg><score>-0.6
And you dont exactly know what is going on ####<neg><score>-0.8
I think it takes place sometime um its i dont think its present day ####<neu><score>0.0
But its um its someone modern i would say ####<pos><score>0.4
Its not its not like a period piece or anything ####<pos><score>0.2
Watch this fucking movie ####<neg><score>-0.5
I think a lot of people are really split about this movie ####<neg><score>-0.4
And um particularly the movies that i feel like shouldve gotten nominated but didnt and never let me go is actually one of those movies ####<pos><score>1.6
It was a pretty slow movie for the most part ####<neg><score>-1.8
Theres a certain deadpan nature to it ####<neg><score>-0.8
But there are you know therere critics of movies that are sometimes too thoughful in a way and i think that would never let me go ####<neg><score>-0.8
And it was it was thoughful ####<pos><score>1.0
Um in a way a lot of the themes in never let me go which were very profound and deep ####<pos><score>1.6
A lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to um explore the themes in the film and you know tightly so i guess which ####<neg><score>-1.8
And i think that the movie did rely on you to kind of figure it out and kind of deal with those ideas by yourself ####<neu><score>0.0
They werent fully explored ####<neg><score>-1.2
Those three are some of the best young actors of today ####<pos><score>2.6
But regardless i thought it was a very good movie ####<pos><score>2.2
And keira knightley i mean everybody knows her from the pirates of the carribean ####<neg><score>-0.4
She and everything she does she has so much grace to it and so much fluidity ####<pos><score>2.0
And andrew garfield of course everybody knows him form the social network ####<neu><score>0.0
But i mean in her other works like pride and prejudice shes just been realy fantastic ####<pos><score>2.6
But anyways they did um they did act very well ####<pos><score>1.4
So look out for that that should be interesting ####<pos><score>1.2
And children will like the movie ####<pos><score>1.6
Parents will find themselves laughing as they reminisce they childhood ####<pos><score>1.6
Since the smurfs are so adorable and they go on thrilling adventures ####<pos><score>2.0
At first i thought the movie would appeal more to younger audience ####<neg><score>-0.2
I think the movie really depicted the liveliness of new york city while since im a new yorker myself ####<pos><score>2.0
But i actually found myself enjoying the movie and laughing ####<pos><score>1.8
The movie also delivers many meaningful messages ####<pos><score>2.0
I also liked how the storyline of the movie worked together smoothly ####<pos><score>2.0
Theyre so hilarious and similar to xxx person with that ####<pos><score>2.0
I also thought some parts of the movie were funny for example um gargamels cat facial expressions ####<pos><score>1.8
It is a fun family film ####<pos><score>1.8
I recommend this film to children six and up ####<pos><score>2.2
I was kind of upset about that ####<neg><score>-1.0
Theres a giant ass twist to this movie at the end ####<pos><score>1.6
Like its obviosly not like a serious fucking movie or anything ####<neg><score>-1.0
Its comedy romantic romcom raoa ####<pos><score>0.2
And she didnt really act like me at all ####<neg><score>-0.5
And i was kind of upset about it ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because like she mustve been an animal and she wasnt ####<neg><score>-0.5
And i was thinkin like if i can be mother fucking emma stone and chris can be royan gosling and that would be just great didnt really happen in the movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Im a little disappointed in myself for not realising the twist before it actually twisted ####<neg><score>-1.0
Because like what the fuck like thats what im good at ####<neg><score>-1.25
Or what i would like to call rayan gosling leather shoe and suit porn ####<neg><score>-0.8
So theres not gonna be any of bad shit ####<pos><score>0.8
But i actually really fucking love this movie ####<pos><score>2.8
I think that that they personally thought that rachel withers really fucking love suits and ryan gosling so they made this movie with me in mind ####<pos><score>0.8
So anyway the movie was really fucking awesome ####<pos><score>3.0
I wish i was ryan gosling ####<pos><score>1.6
No really like rachel whiters needs some fucking fat material ####<neg><score>-2.2
Im not gonna fucking spoil anything for you just because that would be rude ####<neg><score>-1.2
Ryan gosling the best part in the movie ####<pos><score>1.0
Best part of the fucking ass movie was this one scene where ryan gosling was just standing there in a fucking suit eating pizza in slow ass motion ####<pos><score>1.2
And you should all go out and see it and you know stuff ####<pos><score>1.6
Emma stone was in this movie as well and you wouldnt really know it coz she was hardly in it ####<neg><score>-1.6
That was just like hu like zooming in on him and im just like sitting here like any mother fuckers drop ####<neg><score>-0.8
Coz you know apparently according to people on the internet aka tumbler because everyone on tumbler is on crack they all think i look like her or like sound like her or act like her ####<neg><score>-0.75
And i was really upset about it ####<neg><score>-2.2
Like i kind of sound like i might have a penis ####<neg><score>-0.5
I dont know i guess we both have like that like mm male sounding voice ####<neu><score>0.0
We both like flooged in shit ####<neg><score>-0.25
And yeah i know we both have that like an easy way ####<pos><score>0.2
I knew that inception that they were gonna be dreaming ####<neu><score>0.0
Im gonna spoil skins right now i totally knew manny and rick were gonna be related i fucking knew it like i knew it ####<neg><score>-0.5
Really good soundtrack ####<neu><score>0.0
But it was a realy good movie ####<pos><score>2.4
These two developments together caused what was up to that point a noble effort to start falling apart at the seams ####<neg><score>-1.6
And it was painful to watch ####<neg><score>-2.6
I dont even know why i really should begin with listing off the negatives but im going to start with a few of the superficial things ####<neg><score>-2.4
The acting ranges from mediocrity to hamfisted from the live action actors ####<neg><score>-1.6
And um i thought it worked worked pretty well ####<pos><score>1.6
Um and in fact in spite of all the negatives im about to mention i thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third um but at the end of act one two significant things happened ####<neg><score>-0.8
Hactor hummand arrives and starts chewing scenery like its a two dollar steak ####<neg><score>-1.6
And how jordan flies off to the green lantern core planet oh and the movie starts sequel baiting ####<neg><score>-1.0
But i cant really blame them for that ####<neg><score>-0.2
This is star wars prequal territory ####<neg><score>-0.4
I cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequatly without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie ####<neg><score>-0.75
And put them in a justice leage movie with the ritual batman and superman ####<pos><score>0.25
It was widely believed that a sucess of green lantern movie would lead warner brothers to adapt the flash and wonder woman among possibly others ####<pos><score>0.8
It had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that others stuff ####<neg><score>-0.2
So not only that this movie have to deal with the burden of telling its own selfcontained story and setting up its own inevitable sequels ####<neg><score>-0.4
To all the green lantern fans out there i am so sorry ####<neg><score>-2.0
Yeah not good ####<neg><score>-2.0
And warner brothers is never gonna give you one ####<neg><score>-1.0
I say that for two reasons first because someone owes you an appologie ####<neg><score>-1.0
Before i get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives ####<pos><score>0.4
And secondly because as a marvell geek i have experienced my fair share of disappointments over the last decade and i can genuinly symphatize with you ####<neg><score>-0.75
They do a great job with their roles ####<pos><score>2.0
I love jeffrey rush and michael clarke duncan as the voice actors ####<pos><score>1.4
I also love the casting of mark strong as sinestro ####<pos><score>2.0
They are great additions ####<pos><score>1.6
And um finally a particular stand out scene for me was the fighter jet sequence ####<pos><score>1.4
Hes perfect for that role ####<pos><score>2.2
I thought it was really well put together ####<pos><score>2.4
It was by far my favorite action seen in the movie ####<pos><score>2.2
But still its that kind of movie making ####<neg><score>-0.4
The acting is not that bad ####<neg><score>-0.8
But um yeah go check it out ####<pos><score>1.4
Its one its one to check out in theaters i would say ####<pos><score>1.2
Um snif but yeah so the green hornet it was ok ####<pos><score>1.0
I expected a little bit more seriousness ####<neg><score>-1.0
Youll have fun ####<neu><score>0.0
And youll laugh ####<pos><score>1.2
It is funny its a funny movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Lots of lots of laugh out loud moment i guess you could say ####<pos><score>1.6
But it was still good ####<pos><score>1.2
It get it gets pretty serious ####<pos><score>0.2
And it was actually pretty good ####<pos><score>2.0
He was the same old goofy seth rogan that we all know ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um i was expecting seth rogan to be a little bit more serious in this movie but he wasnt ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um i think that i mean i had fun with it ####<pos><score>1.4
Um but it was still a good film ####<pos><score>1.4
And um because of that i was expecting seth rogan to maybe try to be a little bit more serious but he wasnt ####<neg><score>-0.8
So to me thats a pretty good movie ####<pos><score>1.4
Um i still had fun with it ####<pos><score>1.4
But you know thats ok i guess ####<pos><score>0.4
And all the action scenes were great ####<pos><score>2.0
Um the car the black beauty that was amazing all the guns even the car over there that was really sweet ####<pos><score>2.8
Um he was good ####<pos><score>1.4
The special effects were great and the guy who played kato whose first name is j ####<pos><score>1.6
And he did a great job ####<pos><score>2.0
He played kato perfectly ####<pos><score>2.0
And the action was good ####<pos><score>1.6
Um the acting was was pretty good ####<pos><score>1.2
Coz take a bunch of your friends because you you guys will have a good time ####<pos><score>1.6
Um i would definatelly recommend you go see it in theaters ####<pos><score>2.2
Too pretty intense at the end ####<pos><score>1.0
And um fun at the end ####<pos><score>1.2
He is perfect from start to finsih ####<pos><score>2.4
Harisson ford is a long for the ride and having a blast as the second lead ####<pos><score>1.0
And the cast is pretty well rounded out with suppordting performance from guys like sam rockwell as the doc ####<pos><score>1.6
Theyre all playing cliched stock western characters ####<neg><score>-0.4
And the same thing has more or less happened here yeah thats right ####<neg><score>-0.4
The movie called cowboys and aliens daniel craig steels the whole damn show ####<pos><score>2.4
Hes playing a variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by clint eastwood ####<pos><score>0.5
And now that ive seen him in the role i cant imagine any other current actor trying ot pull it off ####<pos><score>1.4
But i really dont care that the characters are walking cliches when they are this well done ####<pos><score>1.6
And the actors do such a good job of carrying of their particular arcs ####<pos><score>2.0
Cowboys and aliens metaphoricaly speaking is like one of those nfl teams that has the talent to be a super bowl champion but instead ends up being a wild cart team that just gets dismissed in the first round of playoffs ####<neg><score>-1.0
I mean it wasnt a bad year ####<neg><score>-0.4
Yeah job pretty well done ####<pos><score>0.8
And that describes cowboys and aliens pretty well ####<neu><score>0.0
But there was a lot of potential left on the table ####<neu><score>0.0
Because given all the strikes that it had going against before wonder production it could have been much much worse ####<pos><score>0.2
Though i guess i should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did ####<pos><score>1.4
But this probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising bad expectations to unreasonable levels ####<neg><score>-1.2
Fortunally some good decisions were made before the camara started rolling ####<pos><score>1.75
The final product ultimately doesnt live up to the high order of that first trailer ####<neg><score>-1.6
When i saw the first trailer back in november of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must see movies for 2011 ####<pos><score>2.4
But if thats all youre looking for youll actually miss the best thing about this movie ####<pos><score>0.6
But its still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens yeah youll pretty much get your fill ####<pos><score>1.2
I mean yeah hes a competent action director ####<neg><score>-0.6
Jon favreau is probably not the guy that i would hire if i was looking for a director for an action movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
But its action isnt particulary memorable ####<neg><score>-1.6
Hes action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow slope that we see in a typical michael bay movie ####<neu><score>0.0
The ironman films are fondly remembered mostly for robert doweny jr not the action ####<pos><score>0.2
And the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any on those movies ####<neg><score>-1.4
Six different people got writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect ####<neg><score>-0.4
Cowboys and aliens problem is the screenplay ####<neg><score>-2.0
The writing isnt as good as the first ####<neg><score>-1.6
The storyline isnt this good ####<neg><score>-2.0
But if you dont expect a lot i think youll enjoy it ####<pos><score>1.0
Snap most of the critics are right ####<neg><score>-1.75
But if you loved the series and you also liked xxx the first movie than youre still gonna have fun ####<pos><score>1.6
It just really heh ####<neg><score>-1.0
If your pet pees carrie wore those horrendous hideous hats they were not catching the ball ####<neg><score>-1.8
Just go in with low expectaions ####<neg><score>-1.2
A few times i thought that was bumped way over the top ####<neg><score>-1.0
And a few times i didnt like the fashion ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um but you know the premise is ok ####<pos><score>0.4
And they kind of looked like clowns the desert scene was one of them ####<neg><score>-1.2
The movie is really too long ####<neg><score>-0.8
And there are a few nice moments ####<pos><score>1.0
Its not even necessary for the plot ####<neg><score>-1.6
They shouldve just cut the wedding in the beginning ####<neg><score>-1.4
But also not necessary ####<neg><score>-1.0
I also thought that desert riding the camels all troup stopped looking like clowns ####<neg><score>-0.2
And um it was just fun to see your old friends again ####<pos><score>1.4
But i love the moment with charlotte in the closet because who hasnt experienced that ####<pos><score>2.2
But dont expect much ####<neg><score>-1.8
So if your a fan id do it ####<pos><score>0.8
And its just like or why do we need these things ####<neg><score>-1.4
It doesnt make any sense ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because when the old flynn finds these things whatever they are theyre so wise and naive kinda like navi now that i think about it ####<pos><score>0.8
Clue which is the program that he created in the first movie kinda pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turns into a crazy jealous psycho stalker bitch ####<neu><score>0.0
But then sam flynn meets his father and tron basically turns into a star wars prequel after that one ####<neg><score>-1.4
Disconnection then that happens at that point ####<neg><score>-0.8
The writers just pull this out of their ass ####<neg><score>-2.2
And the whole movie becomes about these crazy i i isos ####<neg><score>-2.0
And clue has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever cause what is a what is clue ####<neg><score>-2.0
For some kind of freaky teleportation ####<neu><score>0.0
Im a big fan of the first tron ####<pos><score>1.4
Because um in at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers can do every every anything ####<pos><score>0.4
Um i thought this is the perfect time to have a tron sequel ####<pos><score>2.2
Because it kinda controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a tron sequel ####<pos><score>1.4
And everything and now technology actually does anything and everything ####<pos><score>0.25
Lip smacking but i will say that the first third of this movie is amazing ####<pos><score>2.6
Unfortunately um the writers and i were not exactly on the same wavelength ####<neg><score>-1.8
But you know the pacing is so good ####<pos><score>2.0
Its the best summer movie ive seen all year ####<pos><score>2.4
You have lots of uh references to the first movie ####<pos><score>0.2
It gets straight into the story ####<pos><score>1.0
And once sam flynn enters the grid you know the soundtrack draws you in ####<pos><score>1.4
You have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones ####<pos><score>0.666666666667
Uh they dont waste a lot of time on exposition ####<neg><score>-0.4
The special effects look amazing ####<pos><score>2.6
And let me tell you the games look great ####<pos><score>2.4
Because the minute the soundplane enters the grid he is put in the games ####<pos><score>0.25
Um the cho the choreography of the fights the special effects i was so happy to be back in the grid that i wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going ####<pos><score>1.8
All those action sequences in involving the games were great to watch ####<pos><score>2.0
And its like youre a computer program okay if you want to take over the world using real people its the worst way you could possibly do that infiltrate some computer system somewhere and detonate some nukes or something ####<neg><score>-2.0
She displays the emotional distress of her character so well ####<pos><score>1.6
You actually feel for her character ####<pos><score>1.8
You know shes going through the stress and you feel sorry for her and you wanna help her ####<pos><score>1.0
Olso this is one of the best performances ive ever seen out of hers ####<pos><score>2.8
Ive not seen one bad movie that shes been into ####<pos><score>1.6
Teriffic in that ####<neg><score>-1.0
But mary elizabeth winstead i must say she is a teriffic and beautiful and talented acress ####<pos><score>2.4
I was very impressed with his work on the first one ####<pos><score>1.6
But the second one it didnt in some ways take to the next level ####<pos><score>0.4
I thought the first one was creative and inventive and really brought something new to the cinema ####<pos><score>2.0
So it was just about equal to the first one ####<neg><score>-0.2
But in some ways the first one was better ####<neg><score>-1.0
Now um but some of the brush plot that you mey think i hated this movie but youre wrong actually i did ####<pos><score>1.2
Now um but some of the brush plot that you mey think i hated this movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
First im gonna get into the acting which was much much better than the second one ####<pos><score>2.2
I really liked it ####<pos><score>0.8
I did like the second one ####<pos><score>0.6
The second one had wooden acting in some places im sorry ####<neg><score>-1.8
But the rest of the actors were so wooden ####<neg><score>-1.4
But there most of the actors we so witty exeption may be the police cop and kim kimberly ####<pos><score>0.4
I dont know they do seem they need to learn acting better ####<neg><score>-1.2
They were just theyre just they just why acting what theyre doing anyway ####<neg><score>-1.8
Anyway mary elizabeth winstead oh my god she is a teriffic ####<pos><score>2.0
Anyway the further i went acting was much much better in the second one ####<pos><score>1.8
But she is also a teriffic actress ####<pos><score>2.2
Shes nice looking as well ####<neu><score>0.0
It was pretty much just and excuse to put traps in the movie because it was literally completely irrelevant ####<neg><score>-2.2
Like i said i loved the hoffmans storyline ####<pos><score>2.2
But the end was really you you know ####<neg><score>-1.0
But i thought the best part of saw 5 was the storyline like in general ####<pos><score>1.8
The ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual ####<neg><score>-0.8
It was not a real huge saw twist moment ####<neg><score>-0.6
But luckily hoffmans story um was a really really really awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
And um it totally made up for that so thats ok ####<pos><score>1.2
And i guess thats sort of true ####<pos><score>0.4
Because i sure didnt see the end coming ####<neu><score>0.0
So you know i guess it balances out ####<pos><score>0.2
Um so you know that was a little surprising i guess ####<pos><score>0.4
Thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was ####<pos><score>1.4
But ill smack them in the face for the other irrelevant plotline ####<neg><score>-2.6
And dont know what the hell they were thinking ####<neg><score>-2.2
Because im still excited about it ####<pos><score>1.8
Ok all of you knew that obviously ####<neu><score>0.0
As some of you might not notice i was extremly excited about saw 5 ####<pos><score>2.0
And excited to see it ####<pos><score>1.6
So i was you know really hyped up ####<pos><score>1.8
Not exectly what i was expecting ####<pos><score>0.6
And i have to say that it was definately better than the saw 4 ####<pos><score>1.6
And um its just made me really really excided for saw 6 ####<pos><score>2.4
But it was still really really really good ####<pos><score>2.2
So congratulations to the writers for that ####<pos><score>2.0
And it fit very well into the saw series in my opinion ####<pos><score>1.8
And the other one was completely irrelevant as far as i can tell ####<neg><score>-1.8
One of them was great ####<pos><score>1.0
And the irrelevant plot was with five rendom strangers ####<neg><score>-1.2
The great plot was with hoffman tying up all loose ends and stuff ####<pos><score>2.2
But i totally missed how it tied it to the movie at all ####<neg><score>-0.8
Kind of like in saw 2 ####<neu><score>0.0
So that was really bizzare and i didnt care about the characters at all ####<neg><score>-2.6
And im pretty sure thats because it didnt tie in to the movie at all ####<neg><score>-1.6
So it was just really really strange ####<neg><score>-0.8
Because they werent you know introduced well really ####<neg><score>-1.2
Which is still good ####<pos><score>1.4
But it was not exectly what i was expecting and se seriously everything leading up to the end was better than the ending ####<neg><score>-1.0
But like i said the plot of hoffman and everything that was really really awesome ####<pos><score>2.6
And it didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it over or anything its just open ####<neg><score>-1.5
But man oh man it really left the door open ####<pos><score>0.8
And it pretty much just left the door wide open for saw 6 ####<pos><score>0.2
Saw 5 has left like no closure at all at the end of the movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
Because the movie is good ####<pos><score>2.0
Hah so everyone like everyone in cinema was kind like me ####<pos><score>0.8
Because everytime that was like a jump everyone jumped ####<pos><score>0.8
You could feel the jump in ####<pos><score>1.0
And everyone was laughing afterwards ####<pos><score>1.0
And i would go to the cinema again to see it ####<pos><score>1.2
Because that atmosphere like everyone just screeams ####<pos><score>0.4
And just and its just its so funny ####<pos><score>0.8
Um something like what i do like if i jump a lot ####<pos><score>1.75
I think thats how they cope with getting jum like scared and jump and stuff ####<pos><score>0.4
From there it does get a bit like huh not as real as what has been going on ####<neg><score>-1.0
And it is jumpy for people who dont like getting scared or jumpy or anything ####<neg><score>-1.0
And like i do jump ####<pos><score>0.4
But for someone like me who loves horror movies ####<pos><score>0.6
So i think im like immune to them ####<neg><score>-0.6
But i dont exactly get scared ####<neg><score>-0.8
I just thats freaky as hell yeha ####<pos><score>0.5
And the only he mo film that im really scared about is small soldiers ####<neg><score>-0.4
Like it cracked on streight away with what the hell is going on ####<neg><score>-1.0
But insidious um star really good ####<pos><score>0.8
And some of the acting is a little bit like oh my god you wouldnt really do that ####<neg><score>-1.2
Like it dosnt just like and i was at um theres a problem theres a story like adn its like streight away fun storyline started ####<pos><score>0.2
But its just sometimes its just a little bit like oh god they realy shouldnt have done that cringe ####<neg><score>-0.6
But thats like old movies its just like i wouldnt say bad casting ####<neg><score>-1.4
Like really jumped me my friend ####<neg><score>-0.75
Um but really good ####<pos><score>1.6
But it really surprised as i said what you wanna go home ####<neg><score>-0.8
And she wanted to go home and thats like seeing a lot for her coz she likes horror movies as much as i do ####<neg><score>-1.2
I jumped hell of a lot times ####<pos><score>1.4
Huh but i am it was jumpy ####<neg><score>-0.5
Because there is people that wanna go and see it havent seen it yet and might see this video ####<pos><score>0.2
Its kind of like quite fake like i just i couldnt believe it i was like what what are you doing ####<neg><score>-2.25
But overall i enjoyed it ####<pos><score>1.6
Whoever wrote this isnt the writer definatelly ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um and the movie was pretty short ####<neg><score>-0.6
The the whole movie i was you know thinking this isn as bad as ive heard and it wasnt ####<pos><score>1.2
Other than that um i think it was and ok movie ####<pos><score>0.8
And the dialogue threw me off ####<neg><score>-1.0
I dont think its as bad as you probably read on reviews ####<pos><score>0.2
Definatelly a little bit above average ####<pos><score>1.2
So yeah go see it ####<pos><score>1.4
I mean it starts out really slow ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was a cool movie ####<pos><score>1.4
But overall um go see it ####<pos><score>0.8
Um i thought they casted kind of well ####<pos><score>1.0
The acting was allright ####<pos><score>0.2
Oh my god the whole movie had a really dry dialogue ####<neg><score>-1.6
But what really threw me off was the dialogue very cheezy dialogue ####<neg><score>-2.4
But i dont think the humour redeemed the movie from being so bad in the dialogue department ####<neg><score>-1.8
There were a couple funny parts ####<pos><score>0.4
Um it has it has a very predictable story ####<neg><score>-1.4
And again it does really tug at the heart strenghts with the little baby animals at the beginning ####<pos><score>1.4
But if it was anne hathaway who did the singing she did a great job ####<pos><score>2.4
That so what is still a really great movie to take your whole family to ####<pos><score>1.8
Anyway um i would recommend it if if youre like me and you dont normally go to see animated movies ####<pos><score>1.2
I had no idea that anne hathaway could really sing ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um but there really hasnt been much to has come out this year so far that im dying to go see ####<neg><score>-0.2
And im im not really in a big hurry at my age to go see animated movies ####<neg><score>-0.2
And i was thoroughly um surprised ####<pos><score>0.6
And we really wanted to get out of the house um last night ####<neu><score>0.0
At how much i really did enjoy it ####<pos><score>2.0
Anywayit was a really cute movie ####<pos><score>2.0
I really didnt wanna go see it ####<neg><score>-1.4
I did not think i was gonna like it ####<neu><score>0.0
And i was pleasantly surprised by this movie ####<pos><score>1.8
And it seems to me than when production companies start pushing movies that far ahead and when they were gonna be released that usaually means that they are not gonna be great ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um this is a great family movie to take your whole family to this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
I was i thoroughly enjoyed it ####<pos><score>2.4
Um i thought the story line was really cute ####<pos><score>2.0
Its great for all ages ####<pos><score>2.2
So i would recommend this movie ####<pos><score>1.4
Um but they also did a great job in building the backstory of jane foster played by natalie portman and her crew and how they relate to thor ####<pos><score>2.0
So i think that was really good ####<pos><score>1.8
They didnt belabored thor on earth ####<pos><score>0.25
He sounded like he didnt learn from the earthlings ####<neg><score>-0.4
Or why why are they here ####<neu><score>0.0
You have to establsih that fairly quickly ####<neu><score>0.0
And i think that directors of thor and the script writers did that right away ####<pos><score>0.6
You saw thor for how hes in the comics pompous an arogant individual ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um so that makes sense ####<neu><score>0.0
You get other whole shield involvement which is cool to see that a lot of cooler references that at one point they reference im a doctor with gama radiation ####<pos><score>2.4
I would put money on it that it is going to be the blockbuster hit of the summer in terms of when you look at all the movies ####<pos><score>2.6
I think that would do very well ####<pos><score>1.2
I im a cap guy captain america fan ####<pos><score>1.0
I think its gonna catapult chris hemsworth to be even a bigger star ####<pos><score>1.6
Um so i think thor is really gonna do well ####<pos><score>1.0
Charlie sheen was winning there ####<pos><score>1.6
Um great 80s movie for those who havent seen it ####<pos><score>2.8
So they could um um kind of get a little bit of chris hemsworth star power into that ####<pos><score>0.8
And hes winning no ####<pos><score>0.5
They did very well to establish the character of thor ####<pos><score>1.6
Um great movie overall ####<pos><score>2.2
And you saw this with the nbc recent flop of the cape which is a show i love ####<neg><score>-0.2
The problem with a lot of comic book shows and movies ####<neg><score>-1.2
And they needed character established right away ####<neg><score>-1.4
But the audience that was watching it they needed they needed a pay off right away ####<neg><score>-0.2
And why is this person wearing tights ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um what you get in the sitcoms in terms of comic books and kind of the movies that take so loud to build that ####<neu><score>0.0
You know why what is their mission ####<neg><score>-0.4
Or why are they carrying a hammer ####<neg><score>-0.666666666667
Its sexy but not slutty ####<pos><score>1.4
That the dancers um wonderful ####<pos><score>2.2
Um the songs in the movie are wonderful ####<pos><score>1.6
Who is drop dead gorgeous by the way ####<pos><score>1.4
And overall probably id give it about 35 stars you know popcorn movie and you know ####<pos><score>0.8
You know it matches the whole theme of the movie you know cabaret and you know the looks ####<pos><score>1.0
This one you know probably in the middle so 35 stars ####<neg><score>-0.2
Considering all the awesome movies that we had and xxx inception the black swan and you know the social network ####<pos><score>0.2
And if you have money to spend go ahead ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um first things first christina aguileras xxx i swear the xxx xxx ####<pos><score>1.5
And she sure can sing really really well in this movie you know ####<pos><score>2.0
Um why i said that is because she is god a crazy crazy voice ####<pos><score>0.75
But she still looks like shes 48 ####<neg><score>-1.6
And you know it makes you wanna know who else you know in the history of nowadays has the voice like that and you know its noone ####<neg><score>-0.4
Coz when you see her face moves it feels like you know you feel worried for her ####<pos><score>0.75
And her face doesnt move at all ####<neg><score>-1.4
And overall the movies quite entertaining ####<pos><score>1.6
You feel like her face is going to fall apart ####<neg><score>-1.2
But im really really really glad i saw it ####<pos><score>1.6
And i would recommend it to other people its true ####<pos><score>1.8
Even though i was like hu im gonna hate it ####<neg><score>-0.5
But im just gonna have to say it ####<neu><score>0.0
But yeah generally the accents were really really good ####<pos><score>2.6
So good one you america for doing that ####<pos><score>1.4
I doubt that theyre gonna do this for all the screenings because it was the premiere ####<pos><score>0.4
I would not have chosen to go and see that ####<neu><score>0.0
Its my favorite film ever ####<pos><score>2.0
Um its not my favorite film ever ####<neg><score>-0.4
It was amazing ####<pos><score>2.8
And i actually liked the film a lot ####<pos><score>2.2
The premiere itself was really cool ####<pos><score>1.8
Because i thought how the hell is dickens and disney gonna work together like this ####<neg><score>-1.0
And i wasnt expecting to ####<pos><score>0.2
And the end part is really really funny ####<pos><score>2.4
But i thought they actually worked pretty well ####<pos><score>2.0
Hes like what a delightful child ####<pos><score>1.4
Because hes been such a grumpy character and hes really scared and in the end hes so changed and hes really funny ####<pos><score>1.4
The animation was amazing ####<pos><score>2.8
And its all kind of its hard to explain ####<pos><score>0.25
Because sometimes 3d isnt really that good ####<neg><score>-1.0
I wasnt expecting that much ####<neg><score>-0.4
You kind of forget about the fact that it is 3d ####<pos><score>1.0
But it was fenomenal ####<pos><score>2.6
That was one of my other concerns ####<neg><score>-0.8
The voices are really good ####<pos><score>2.2
But than its so obviously not an english character ####<neg><score>-0.2
Was that as an english person i get really annoyed when american shows and films have an english character ####<neg><score>-1.8
I can imagine getting this on dvd and watching it at christmas at time because it makes you feel so like huh its not about commercialization its about you know families being together ####<pos><score>2.4
But i would definately watch it again ####<pos><score>2.0
Which were um a disasterous ####<neg><score>-1.6
But i just wanted to put this up soon ####<pos><score>0.4
And ill tell you all about like the cool premiere and stuff ####<pos><score>0.8
Theres not like a really good twist ####<neg><score>-2.0
Its a good action movie ####<pos><score>1.8
Its like 90 bourne identity meets 10 willy wonka ####<neg><score>-0.6
Theres some really strange characters in this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because i went into the movie thinking theres no way ####<neg><score>-1.25
And so they kind of explain it a little bit but not really ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um i i at the end of the movie the friends i was with uh one of them goes was there a plot to this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
It doesnt have a deep seeded plot ####<neg><score>-2.0
It was it did add to the movie though it ####<pos><score>1.4
And it visually its kinda cool how they show her confusion because she grows up in the woods ####<pos><score>1.8
And i was pretty open to to it being good ####<pos><score>0.6
I was like theres no way that theyre gonna be able to convince me that a sixteen year old girl can take down like six adult dudes ####<neg><score>-1.6
I at first when i saw the previews i thought it was gonna be stupid to be perfectly honest ####<neg><score>-0.8
And they both liked it ####<pos><score>1.4
So i saw some other reviews and i was like okay i was surprised ####<pos><score>0.4
And i gotta say i wasnt blown away by it ####<neg><score>-1.4
They s and all the people walking out of the theatre and beyond the trailer really liked it ####<pos><score>1.6
It was good ####<pos><score>1.6
I didnt think it was great or epic or just fantastic ####<neg><score>-0.2
Which is cool ####<pos><score>1.2
The music kinda drove a lot of the action ####<pos><score>0.2
It was it was an it was an okay movie ####<pos><score>0.6
I mean i dont regret seeing it ####<pos><score>1.2
Anyways skipping past that shes got this like kick a attitude ####<pos><score>0.4
Eric bana decides to train to be this most paranoid asassin chick in the world ####<neg><score>-0.6
Its good ####<pos><score>0.6
So its it kind of feels like a sundance film festival type of movie ####<neg><score>-0.4
Its not polished quite as much as i would like it to be ####<neg><score>-1.0
But its not great ####<neg><score>-1.0
Like they convinced me like this chick could probably take that dude down which is pretty hard ####<pos><score>1.0
It is good though ####<pos><score>1.8
It was original ####<pos><score>1.6
So it it was and interesting movie ####<pos><score>1.6
I did like kind of like the action ####<pos><score>1.0
It wasnt the it wasnt the usual ####<neg><score>-1.2
But it was it was interesting ####<pos><score>1.8
Um it wasnt bad ####<pos><score>0.8
The soundtrack was interesting ####<pos><score>1.2
And i liked it ####<pos><score>1.5
That you respect that joe wright tried to do something completely different here ####<pos><score>1.2
But i think its one of those movies thats so unique ####<pos><score>2.2
Its in your face ####<pos><score>0.25
Its colorful ####<pos><score>1.6
And i think um what i took away from this was that really tried very hard to make something original ####<pos><score>1.8
Its really non stop from beginning to end ####<pos><score>1.4
And something that i cant find anything else to compare it to ####<pos><score>1.33333333333
This is his most engaging endevour yet ####<pos><score>2.4
He takes great actors or acresses in this case like saoirse ronan and cate blanchett ####<pos><score>1.4
And he what he does with hanna is he makes the movie on like anything weve seen before ####<pos><score>1.2
Um what really need about this movie is the chamical brothers did the soundtracks whats pulse pounding the entire way through ####<pos><score>1.4
And he puts them in very strange and unusual characters ####<neu><score>0.0
Theres all these colorful characters ####<pos><score>2.0
You never know whats gonna happen ####<pos><score>0.6
I gave it a b ####<pos><score>1.4
Now it isnt a great fantastic tell everybody about that kind of movie ####<neu><score>0.0
So easy on the eyes ####<pos><score>2.0
Um i think hes my new favorite ####<pos><score>1.2
Yeah so i suggest that you guys all watch this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
I always like to read the book first ####<pos><score>0.5
Because priscilla from the readables gave a such a good review ####<pos><score>0.6
Its a weird thing ####<neg><score>-0.5
It was so good ####<pos><score>2.6
Um i suggest that you guys go and watch this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Um usually im not really a big huge scifi alien kind of fan ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um its surpassed my expectations ####<pos><score>2.4
Um i really wanna go read the book now ####<pos><score>1.8
But um it was really really good ####<pos><score>3.0
I heard that in the book it describes um the plan of the glory a lot better ####<neg><score>-1.0
Coz im so curious to see um how the storyline um got to that point ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um i cant wait until the next one comes out too ####<pos><score>1.8
Um gives more details so i cant wait to get my hands on it now ####<pos><score>1.4
Um he wrote a good book ####<pos><score>1.75
Um it it turns out that james fray who um i realy like ####<pos><score>1.2
Im really excited ####<pos><score>2.0
Um and i cant wait for the next one to come out ####<pos><score>2.4
He was unbelievable ####<pos><score>1.6
Um as for alex xxx i am a new alex fan ####<pos><score>0.8
But um it was in a good taste ####<pos><score>1.8
I was surprised um the amount of skin they showed ####<neg><score>-0.4
He um added a grat dimension to the movie as well ####<pos><score>1.8
Um and i thought woody harelson was a funny ####<pos><score>1.6
But overall i thought it was it was a fun picture ####<pos><score>2.0
Storyline was ok ####<pos><score>0.6
Um certianly again more of a day movie than um seeing it alone ####<pos><score>0.2
I i do think its worth seeing ####<pos><score>1.6
So id go see it ####<pos><score>1.8
Unless you ladies go together to see it together ####<pos><score>0.6
Thumbs up ####<pos><score>1.6
Mila kunis and justin timberlake i thought they made a great duo ####<pos><score>2.4
Theres some great bedroom scenes ####<pos><score>2.2
Mila kunis she is gorgeous ####<pos><score>2.0
A fine light weight day movie ####<pos><score>1.8
You guys are youre gonna get to enjoy ####<pos><score>1.0
Um certainly there are some scenes where i think some of the women are gonna feel more the emotion of it ####<pos><score>0.2
I think some of the women are going to enjoy this more than the guys ####<pos><score>0.4
Great steamy bedroom scenes ####<pos><score>1.0
There are some funny lines ####<pos><score>1.6
I would love that ####<pos><score>1.8
That be that would be cool to see i mean ####<pos><score>0.4
Eventually were gonna get burned out as a soci as a society ####<neg><score>-1.2
Once agian were gonna be burned out on 3d ####<neg><score>-0.8
Coz sometimes 3d can mess up the color at least the old anaglyphic 3d i think real d it you know had sort of had sort of tempted but it winds itself its also um not ideal for for the imigae itslef ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um but this looked amazing looked really good ####<pos><score>2.8
And it makes it worth going to see this movie if youve got um the dolby 3d somewhere in your town ####<pos><score>1.8
And i hope this takes over as the new system ####<pos><score>1.0
Because its it is a gimmick ultmatelly ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um but i will say um with this with this quality of 3d you could almost make you know a regular like a dramatic movie or an action movie or something that was really good movie and you could make it 3d and it wouldnt at all ####<pos><score>1.4
But its actually worth talking about ####<pos><score>1.0
And i actually am not finding the series to be very fun and popcorn kind of movie ####<neu><score>0.0
Because the movie itself is the same old crap from the series ####<neg><score>-2.0
In this case it didnt take much convincing which is a little silly ####<neu><score>0.0
You just cant walk in exopecting anything other than that ####<neg><score>-0.6
The plot is you know ####<neg><score>-0.2
But the acting is bad ####<neg><score>-2.2
I guess for this kind of movie the plot is is is threadbare ####<neg><score>-1.0
Actually the acting is ok ####<pos><score>0.4
But none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway ####<pos><score>1.4
The the um character development is nil ####<neg><score>-2.0
Which is a terrible picture ####<neg><score>-2.4
Its a popcorn movie ####<neg><score>-0.5
I had ideal seats ####<pos><score>1.0
Um but um this 3d definatelly looks a lot better i think that real d ####<pos><score>2.0
Um but the they looked awesome ####<pos><score>1.6
Because its good to sit right in the middle of the theater with 3d ####<pos><score>0.6
Um the color looked great ####<pos><score>2.0
The 3d itself really had improved ####<pos><score>1.2
Number one im getting a little sick of the xxx kind of lead character sort of really awkward boy who is really awkward and stuff you know im getting sick of that character and im tired of it ####<neg><score>-2.8
I have two problems with it ####<neg><score>-1.8
But he might as well ####<pos><score>0.8
And i get angry about it laughter xxx doesnt play best character in the film ####<neg><score>-2.0
Second theres one massive plot hole in this film and it is the size of a dragon that is big as a mountain and when you see the film youll probably know what i mean ####<neg><score>-1.0
So im im im through with that guy ####<neg><score>-1.4
And the only explanation i come up with makes this story kind of kind of creepy ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um theres no explanation for this thing ####<neg><score>-1.6
Other then those two things this is a really fun film that you will enjoy unless you are soleless piece of machenery ####<neg><score>-0.4
I just wanted to let you know that 3d is really ridiculously expensive ####<neg><score>-1.2
You should take your kids ####<pos><score>1.6
You know what you should see how to train your dragon ####<pos><score>1.8
Its probably the best thing currently in theaters ####<pos><score>2.2
And if you dont have kids you may wanna consider seeing it anyway ####<pos><score>1.8
Its a lot of fun to watch ####<pos><score>2.2
It is its a great story ####<pos><score>2.6
And its really well written ####<pos><score>2.0
Its beautifully done ####<pos><score>2.6
They really needed to somehow set them apart with armor ####<neg><score>-1.6
You cant tell which are the good owls which are the bed owls ####<neg><score>-0.6
Or you can see up to you ####<pos><score>0.2
Anyway this is one you can skip ####<neg><score>-1.8
Im gonna give this a grade b minus ####<pos><score>1.2
The flying sequences are beautiful ####<pos><score>2.4
The cgi work the 3d is spectacular ####<pos><score>2.8
And come of real ####<pos><score>0.2
And the owls are really wonderful ####<pos><score>2.2
But the story is very dark ####<neg><score>-1.0
And they do have very nice personalites ####<pos><score>1.6
Um my other complaint other than that theres like nothing light or funny in this story to break up the slumber mood is the battle itself ####<neg><score>-1.8
In fact my six years old was scared most of the movie ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um but hey if youre looking to spend some money um go check it out maybe you will like it ####<neg><score>-1.0
But um from my review im gonna say im gonna give it two thumbs down ####<neg><score>-2.8
Release the cracken on this movie dont go see it go see something else how to train the dragon and um thats all im gonna say about that ####<neg><score>-2.8
So disappointment definately ####<neg><score>-2.0
And my friedns who were there had nothing good to say about it ####<neg><score>-2.4
So unfortunatelly i must say this one is probably gonna be waiting until it comes on hbo ####<neg><score>-1.2
Or get it at um um red box for a buck ####<neg><score>-0.5
Um i just really didnt like it ####<neg><score>-2.0
I did not wanna give this movie a bad review ####<neg><score>-0.2
I im a fan of the original you know loved it ####<pos><score>1.2
Which is a reboot i guess it would be the best term for the i believe it was a 1981 movie clash of the titans ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um i was really looking forward to it ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um unfortunatelly im going to have to say this movie was terrible ####<neg><score>-2.8
Is it gonna be good ####<neg><score>-0.2
I was a little hasitant at firstyou know as you are with with reboots you know ####<neg><score>-0.8
I think that music that music they kind of pull it with the soundtrack really got me excited about seeing this movie ####<pos><score>1.8
But as the trailers came out i i really liked what i was seeing ####<pos><score>1.8
But to me someone needs to release the crackon on this movie and just totally destroy it ####<neg><score>-3.0
And and being a fan of the original i was i was looking forward to seeing it ####<neg><score>-1.0
It seemed like there was no story development in it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Because i just felt like it was it seemed like it was a rushed movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
I felt like medusa really wasnt that scary ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um i just really didnt have good time ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um i just think they made her almost looked too you know they tried that you know make her look too beautiful ####<neg><score>-1.2
Maybe it was coz i was a kid back at that day but medusa was a lot scar scarier then ####<neg><score>-1.0
The screen you know was that i i kind of fo found myself you know wanted to lay my head back and take a nap ####<neg><score>-2.2
But um i just in whole really didnt like this movie ####<neg><score>-2.2
And and after the movie um going out into the theater into the lobby i had noone i heard noone say anything good ####<neg><score>-2.4
And actually the guy sitting next to me actually was taking a nap laughter he kept dozing off ####<neg><score>-1.4
Heard good things about the screenings on that ####<pos><score>1.6
And um but i got to i got to do my duty and let you guys know its a a major suck fest ####<neg><score>-3.0
And um looking really forward to seeing that movie ####<pos><score>1.8
So thats thumbs down if you dont understand ####<neg><score>-2.2
I give it about one and a half stars ####<neg><score>-2.0
But the cgi was great ####<pos><score>1.4
So it is not a buy ####<neg><score>-1.25
Um medusa was way different from percy jackson and glandon laws ####<neg><score>-0.4
And thats exectly how i thought a giant scorpion would look with the piece of driftwood that had blue fire on it ####<neg><score>-0.5
But the best part about the movie i ve got a free pair of glasses ####<neg><score>-1.0
It couldve been better ####<neg><score>-1.0
They couldve made zeus a little less sparkly it was very distracting ####<neg><score>-1.6
The first one was a lot better ####<neg><score>-0.8
The first one made more sense ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um it was very hard to follow ####<neg><score>-2.0
They pretend theres gonna be this big scene it maybe lasts about a minute and i was like is that it ####<neg><score>-1.6
And the crackon you know in the preview is like so much hype ####<neg><score>-1.0
The previews are much more 3d the ne so yeah it was very disappointing ####<neg><score>-1.8
And than its definatelly not a 3d movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
I just get so tired of unpredictable movies ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um yea so anyways its really predictable ####<neg><score>-1.8
I mean you can go see i personally didnt like it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Because i just got really bored with it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um and its really unpredictable ####<neg><score>-0.25
And a guy who looks a lot like tom cruise ####<pos><score>0.2
Uh i personally think its a waste of money ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um lip smacking this movie is dumb ####<neg><score>-2.6
Laughing i just just cant stand movies where its like the same plot as like 50 other million movies ####<neg><score>-2.8
Just because i cant stand movies that are so predictable ####<neg><score>-2.0
I really dont care to see those ####<neg><score>-2.0
Just different just different people playing the roles ####<pos><score>0.4
You know i like kate hudson ####<pos><score>1.2
But you know what i took a chance ####<pos><score>0.2
And dont get me wrong there were you know funny parts in the movie ####<pos><score>0.2
So i thought this movie would be funny ####<pos><score>0.4
I dont care for basically any of it ####<neg><score>-2.2
I just dont care for the plot ####<neg><score>-2.0
Its the same you know rise and fall ####<neg><score>-0.4
Because its predictable ####<neg><score>-1.0
And so shes all sad walking in the rain blah blah blah ####<neg><score>-1.2
But shes in trouble you know cuz she doesnt wanna tell her best friend blah blah blah ####<neg><score>-0.6
Ive been saying that a lot in this video blah blah blah blah ####<neg><score>-1.8
And blah blah blah ####<neg><score>-0.6
Its really like like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles ####<pos><score>0.8
Like the story of swan lake is why people go see swan lake its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience ####<pos><score>1.8
And then you know put in some action or some romance or sex or whatever like to keep people sort of engaged ####<pos><score>0.8
Um and thats what traditionl narrative movies do ####<pos><score>0.4
And this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is ####<neg><score>-1.6
And the characters are they are all just place holders ####<neg><score>-1.6
That was pretty funny and um stupid for movies had this really long like really not really long but like really intense rent a about it ####<pos><score>1.4
I dont think its like the worst movie ive even seen just this year ####<neu><score>0.0
Um and it it is just like everybody saying it is bad ####<neg><score>-2.4
Like i was more entertained by it than battle la which was just a slog and boring and i just try to totally uninteresting ####<pos><score>0.2
But i would say i i enjoyed sucker punch ####<pos><score>1.6
Um it is bad ####<neg><score>-2.2
And sucker punch is a failer but like a really ambitious weird the interesting idiosyncratic failure ####<neg><score>-0.8
Its not bad in the way i was expecting it to be bad ####<neg><score>-0.2
But its not bad i think the way most people have been saying its bad ####<neg><score>-0.2
Like i think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know with drama that we dont get to know anything about these characters their play isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats gonna happen before it happens ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film ####<neu><score>0.0
I think its really much more like a musical ####<pos><score>0.6
Um and and all those things are true but i dont think its trying to be that ####<neg><score>-0.6
But it really has more in common with a musical or and opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film ####<pos><score>0.2
And i know this is gonna sound silly coz its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie ####<pos><score>1.0
So its like puts some people in it and youre gonna enjoy spending time with them ####<pos><score>0.6
Coz like am remains in narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place ####<neg><score>-0.2
Make them compelling in their relationships compelling and then have a story thats like at five minutes this happens and at ten minutes this happens that like moves forward and has momentum ####<neu><score>0.0
Therere some funny dialogue ####<pos><score>1.4
I mean that movie was a waste of time ####<neg><score>-2.6
I mean her acting is like so so and i cant believe she even won a oscar beleive she won an oscar or for best supporting actress or best actress something ####<neg><score>-1.8
And it just really wasnt good ####<neg><score>-2.8
Its two girls trying too hard ####<neg><score>-1.6
What can i say im just curious ####<neu><score>0.0
Yes she has a fat ass in terms of white girls but her ass isnt really that fat ####<neg><score>-1.25
Dont get me wrong kate hudson is is pretty fine looking but i just think its kind of stupid everyone says has a fat ass ####<neg><score>-0.4
I mean the movie really wasnt funny at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
First of all the movie was boring ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean the movie was i guess it was a waste of time ####<neg><score>-1.2
All the all the funny parts werent funny ####<neg><score>-2.0
Anne hathaway is really over rated in my opinion ####<neg><score>-2.2
I wa hey she might like it but even then its not really funny at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
I liked ants ####<neu><score>0.0
I love the shrek films ####<pos><score>2.0
But as far as kung fu panda goes i was hoping for a lot more it just wasnt there for me i dont know ####<neg><score>-1.6
I was a little bit disappointed in the film ####<neg><score>-1.4
It didnt have a whole out of humor going on with it at least none that really made you wanna laugh out loud ####<neg><score>-1.6
But the movie itself was just a little dry ####<neg><score>-1.8
Now im not gonna lie therere a few parts that have great action sequences now even though it is an animated film it did have some great fight scenes ####<pos><score>1.4
Um even the kids and the audience itself just kind of chuckled a little bit gave a few laughs ####<neg><score>-1.0
Everything you see in the trailer itself was pretty much all the humor youre gonna see in the movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um but as far as humor goes not as much as i was expecting ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um maybe better like next time dreamworks but for this one for me it just wasnt what i was hoping it would be ####<neg><score>-2.2
Um um a you know along with the xxx i would probably saying go see this movie an early showing dont spend a lot of money for the night viewing ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um the direction is a bit its wobbly ####<neg><score>-1.2
Its its a bit of a mixed bag coz there were some very bright moments ####<pos><score>0.8
But what it lacks in those areas it most definately makes up for just like sheer visual spectacle ####<pos><score>1.8
Basically a lot of elements that i could take a movie on its really wobbly ####<neg><score>-1.4
So many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of huh thats really really cool ####<pos><score>2.4
I mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movies since probably avatar me if not prettier ####<pos><score>2.6
It it doesnt make much sense i know ####<neg><score>-1.2
And then take that world that have been set like a crap tunnel of really kinetic really well done action sequences in it and you have tron legacy ####<pos><score>2.2
And basically this makes no sense ####<neg><score>-1.8
Main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this like ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences ####<pos><score>0.4
But i do think its a very interesting one ####<pos><score>1.2
And i dont think thats a very good movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
But i was still ridicilously entertained by it ####<pos><score>2.6
I can tell you that tron legacy is not a good movie ####<neg><score>-2.4
Tron legacy is a movie where on most counts that i judge movies it kind of fails ####<neg><score>-1.0
Are these two things possible in the same sentancei i really do think so ####<pos><score>0.8
The script can be horrible ####<neg><score>-2.0
The performances are nah ####<neg><score>-1.4
And some really cool gun fights ####<pos><score>2.0
Um one of the big things i was disappointed though was i felt that they couldve done a lot more with 3d ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um now i dont really recommend this if you go on a date with some girl ####<neg><score>-2.0
And i thought it was just gonna be more than that but so i was a little disappointed in that ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um but if youre xxx movie goer like i am i totally recommend seeing this because its just a fun entertaining movie and i think that you will enjoye it ####<pos><score>2.6
Now this movie is just ridiculous and i i thought it was excellent ####<pos><score>3.0
She didnt really do anything for me ####<neg><score>-1.6
Her acting was pretty bad ####<neg><score>-2.0
And his acting wasnt really good in that movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
But the real star that fell out of this movie was william fichtner character or william fichtner ####<pos><score>1.4
And whatever so no im not saying this movie is bad coz its its not ####<neg><score>-0.8
But it made it hysterical and it was just funny with all of these little one liners that he had ####<pos><score>2.2
It was it was good ####<pos><score>1.8
Like i said before it had tacky one liners that were just hysterical ####<pos><score>1.6
The whole time i saw her all i thought was helen hunt and renee zellwegger ####<neg><score>-0.4
Another thing was the fact that there was not one healthy relationship or positive good relationship in this whole movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
But thats kind of depressing ####<neg><score>-1.4
I dont really know i dont its so weird ####<neg><score>-0.75
And there were times that i thought it was funny ####<pos><score>0.6
I there were times in the movie where i felt really bored ####<neg><score>-1.8
I just dont think it was very good ####<neg><score>-2.2
And there were times that i was just sitting there after they said their jokes and i was like thats not nobodys laughing thats not funny ####<neg><score>-2.2
So i think that no strings attached was better than friends with benefits ####<pos><score>0.8
And this is the thing friends with benefits and no strings attached they are the same movie different ways of getting to the same point but its the same point ####<neg><score>-0.6
I thought it was very funny ####<pos><score>2.0
I was not bored during no strings attached ####<pos><score>0.6
Butsigh it had a lot of really bad moments ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um and uh friends with benefits had its moments ####<neu><score>0.0
He is brilliant there is not a movie that i see him in that i dont end up crying because he is so fantastic and he just breaks your heart whenever he does you know a role that usually his roles do break your heart at some point so definitely did in this movie ####<pos><score>2.8
And he is one of my favorite actors ever ####<pos><score>2.0
The lady who plays justin timberlakes sister um i thought she was very good in this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
I like teared up in friends with benefits because of him ####<pos><score>1.4
And she looks like renee zellwegger and helen hunt from a twister movie ####<neg><score>-0.2
And i thought she was just like really natural and funny ####<pos><score>2.0
It was weird ####<neg><score>-1.0
And she talks like her too ####<pos><score>0.2
Lip smakcing a lot of this movie brings a cute laugh here and there ####<pos><score>1.0
Even though the whole movie is based on whether she gets to dublin in time youre never really worried about it because you know she gets there ####<neg><score>-0.4
And seem to be really enjoying themselves the whole way through ####<pos><score>1.8
And both the actors amy adams and matthew goode work well with each other ####<pos><score>1.4
All in all if youre looking for a cute romantic comedy with a beautiful setting then this will probably be a good movie for you ####<pos><score>2.0
Even when theyre fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike ####<neg><score>-0.8
Which would have been a better name for the movie ####<neg><score>-0.2
The countryside which they showed while going across ireland was astoundingly ble beautiful ####<pos><score>2.0
And i really enjoyed it ####<pos><score>2.2
Although i enjoyed the movie ####<pos><score>1.2
And in the scene with the destroyed castle it really reminded me why i want to go there so badly ####<pos><score>1.4
Its a fun chick flick ####<pos><score>1.6
If i think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great ####<neg><score>-1.2
Lip smacking all the problems that come to stop them from getting to their destination are although plausible a little weak ####<neg><score>-0.8
But other than that it doesnt really hold up under inspection ####<neg><score>-1.6
So zach snyder here is making a movie thats ostensibly about female empow empowerment but its a movie about female empowerment which includes a lot of clearing throat slapping that includes a lot of women in bustiers that includes a lot of violence done against women and ultimately in which most of the women end up completely disempowered ####<neg><score>-2.6
It would be completely inappropriate in fact it would be racist ####<neg><score>-2.2
I could kinda see that in a sort of chris rock dave chapelle way ####<pos><score>1.0
Clapping laughing so okay if zach snyder were a woman i would say okay shes making a comment about the way women cant be empowered in male dominated societies in the way men um distract and and hurt and damage women and prevent them from asserting who they really are ####<neg><score>-0.4
So if i give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt this is a movie that looks great has some bad acting ####<pos><score>0.4
But zach snyder is a guy and because of that this stuff kinda ends up looking like the sh he man woman haters club ####<neg><score>-1.6
If i dont give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt ####<neg><score>-0.6
And has way too much violence against women ####<neg><score>-1.8
Poop ####<neg><score>-2.5
Guardians of owl land whatever that came out and i never saw it ####<neu><score>0.0
Music in background laughing currently in theatres starring no one youve ever heard of ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um heres why yes stuttering t theres problems with this and i wanna talk about them but you know it looks beautiful ####<pos><score>0.4
And this suckers getting this sucker is getting panned like last airbender garbage panned and i wanna say this i did not think it was like last airbender garbage ####<neg><score>-2.6
It actually has some some them thematically it has some cool themes about heroism and about like taking ownership of yourself and things like that which i resonated with and i whi and which i appreciated ####<pos><score>1.8
There are some really cool uh moments in this ####<pos><score>2.0
Um if like me or laughing some other white person or hispanic person or whatever did the same jokes it would not be funny ####<neg><score>-2.0
But heres the essential problem with this movie the essentail problem of this movie well maybe this would be the best way to put it um there was a uh a comedian named dave chapelle um and dave chapelle um and another comedian chris rock are um african american and in their comedy they sometimes take on african american culture what they perceive to be african american culture and so they will essentially make fun of black people and the thing with dave chapelle and with chris rock is because theyre black they can kinda do that and theres something about that thats acceptable ####<neg><score>-1.6
And it wasnt worth it in my opinion to go see it ####<neg><score>-2.4
So that just pissed me off more ####<neg><score>-2.4
And i loved it and this one just was a flat of disappointments ####<neg><score>-2.2
But really i couldve shouldve just walked up and left at that moment ####<neg><score>-2.4
So im gonna rate this one two stars ####<neg><score>-1.8
Because the movie did have some points when i was laughing ####<pos><score>0.4
But very few ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um it was a waste of my time ####<neg><score>-2.8
And i dont suggest anyone go see it ####<neg><score>-2.2
If youre hoping to if you have to have if you have kids and youre forced to go which you probably will if you have kids you know put up with it as a parent ####<neg><score>-1.6
But on your own dont go see it ####<neg><score>-1.8
It couldve been so much better i i couldve i saw it being so much better in my head but it just wasnt ####<neg><score>-2.0
It disappointed me highly ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i was just sort of discouraged after seeing the movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
And im definatelly wish i had my money back ####<neg><score>-3.0
It couldve been so much better ####<neg><score>-1.8
Than the second sequel was really great ####<pos><score>2.2
It was boring ####<neg><score>-2.0
And not at all original in my opinion ####<neg><score>-2.2
Its not really that great ####<neg><score>-2.0
Everyone is split on this one just as they were on spiderman ####<neg><score>-0.4
And the characters just werent the same as the first two that i fell in love with them ####<neg><score>-1.2
It just kind of made me wanna really walk out of the theater ####<neg><score>-2.6
And this is the one that i can say was definatelly disappointed ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i was really hoping that this one be just as good ####<neg><score>-0.8
I love the first shrek and the second shrek ####<pos><score>2.0
I was really disappointed with that ####<neg><score>-2.2
And it just that it hadnt anything new to offer ####<neg><score>-2.2
And it offered nothing of the such ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean i went in there hoping to see something original and funny like the first two ####<neg><score>-1.8
There was a few jokes ok yeah make you giggle or something ####<pos><score>0.6
It wasnt remotly funny ####<neg><score>-0.4
But im gonna give it a two to be fair ####<neg><score>-1.2
But i still find it pointless in the end of the movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean its pleasent to the story ####<neg><score>-0.2
Nothing really that funny ####<neg><score>-1.0
But thats nothing major ####<neg><score>-0.25
The characters are all the same ####<neg><score>-1.6
Or anything original ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i loved puss in boots ####<pos><score>2.0
And not even as good as the first two movies ####<neg><score>-1.2
The donkey and puss in boots rivalry thats going on it just it wasnt as funny the third time around ####<neg><score>-1.8
And he wasnt even that great this time around ####<neg><score>-2.0
Plain and simply it was dull for me ####<neg><score>-2.0
And there was nothing new to offer ####<neg><score>-2.0
I have to agree on the negative side it was not great ####<neg><score>-1.4
And just they are with all the other sequels that are coming out an this one ####<neu><score>0.0
So the addition of this character was pretty pointless ####<neg><score>-1.8
And none of them were really that great i mean stands out in your mind ####<neg><score>-1.4
But they didnt even give him that much to do the he had only few minor lines ####<neg><score>-1.8
And theres a ne an introduction of a new character justine timberlakes character already in the film ####<neg><score>-0.2
I mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny ####<pos><score>0.4
So i definatelly suggest ####<pos><score>0.2
It wasnt even remotely good ####<neg><score>-2.8
It shouldve really be one ####<neg><score>-1.0
Well he plays that well so hes a good villain ####<pos><score>1.4
Its pretty pretty scary looking ####<neg><score>-0.8
He also has some really cool guns so that its like a desert eagle but it has to barrels to it ####<pos><score>2.2
And i who would i mean ####<pos><score>0.5
I wouldnt want that pointed at me ####<neg><score>-0.8
The action they do have is really well done ####<pos><score>1.8
Um like i said i thought the movie was great ####<pos><score>2.2
They did a good job with the fight scenes ####<pos><score>2.0
Um they did a good job with car ####<pos><score>1.6
Um but this movie it had everything humor romance action ####<pos><score>2.6
Of course um it was just it was fun it was a fun entertaining movie ####<pos><score>1.8
Uh it was good for the entire family ####<pos><score>2.0
Um definitely recommend checking seeing this uh checking this movie out ####<pos><score>1.4
Im not even sure what they were ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was just so cool ####<pos><score>2.6
Like a covered wagon horse kinda cowboy chase sequence ####<neg><score>-0.2
Oh it was so cool ####<pos><score>2.2
Uh i rated it four out of five stars ####<pos><score>1.8
Um the one thing i didnt like about this movie was they brought the main chara uh the bad character i should say in kinda late ####<neg><score>-1.5
Now rango was just fantastic ####<pos><score>2.8
Uh it was so much better than i thought it was going to be ####<pos><score>2.4
Surprised me ####<neg><score>-0.25
It had all this stereotypical traits of a western town ####<neg><score>-0.8
And this town was like from a good old western ####<pos><score>0.6
It was a great movie ####<pos><score>2.0
I dunno but it was it was cool ####<pos><score>1.6
The all the animals were just so funny ####<pos><score>2.0
And now what i loved about this movie was like the supporting characters in this movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Theyre like the dumb kinda cowboys that dont know what theyre doing always asking dumb questions staying saying stupid shit ####<neg><score>-2.2
Um they all played off each other ####<pos><score>0.8
And the stuff he said was just it was just so funny ####<pos><score>2.2
And it was just oh it was hysterical ####<pos><score>2.4
All the cinematography in this movie was great ####<pos><score>2.4
And he did a wonderful job ####<pos><score>2.2
Um like this movie had great action sequences ####<pos><score>1.0
Like all the sunsets and all the landscapes of the films they just looked so realistic in every almost every scene ####<pos><score>2.4
Or nah i wouldnt say possums but prairie dogs ####<neg><score>-0.75
This aw this one really cool action sequences where like this ronny uh johnny depps posse they were getting chased by all these like possums ####<pos><score>2.2
Um everything else held up its own ####<pos><score>0.6
But that didnt really matter ####<neg><score>-0.4
Um definitely check out this movie rango uh in a theatre near you ####<pos><score>2.0
I definitely will buy it ####<neu><score>0.0
But uh it was worth the free movie passes that i used on it ####<pos><score>1.6
And thanks for listening to me ramble ####<pos><score>0.4
Uh i really enjoyed doing them for the philly d movie club so i thought oh why not ####<pos><score>1.8
Um i i liked a lot of the movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Uh rango is a really cute movie ####<pos><score>2.2
Um i pretty much will go see any movie that kind of has an interesting plot if hes in it ####<pos><score>0.6
I will admit im a big johnny depp fan ####<pos><score>1.8
I mean corpse bride hes really good in corpse bride ####<pos><score>1.6
Um its not his best ####<neg><score>-1.4
Well its a johnny depp movie so its entertaining ####<pos><score>1.4
And rango kind of falls into that ####<neu><score>0.0
Or something i would recommend ####<neg><score>-0.6
But its not something that i would go buy ####<neg><score>-0.4
Oh it has some really good references of past johnny depp films in it like while the chameleons getting bounced along the highway you run into henry s thompson ####<pos><score>2.0
Unless you have little kids to bring with you ####<pos><score>0.2
I mean johnny depps a wonderful voice actor so um he hes i do hes an incredible voice actor ####<pos><score>1.8
Uh hes super entertaining as the chameleon ####<pos><score>2.2
And be this really quirky little chameleon ####<pos><score>0.4
Like thats really the best part of the movie is listening to him uh pull off all these different voices ####<pos><score>1.8
But if you dont really have any small friends uh that sounded really perverted small children that you are related to um to take to the movies uh i wouldnt go see it by myself ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i i would yeah i would recommend it if you have little kids ####<pos><score>1.0
Okay and now its late ####<pos><score>0.4
Chuckle be forewarned low expectations ####<neg><score>-1.2
Not great ####<pos><score>0.8
Um its just not there ####<neg><score>-2.0
Sigh i really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that than the other shrek movies ####<neg><score>-1.6
But its really not wonderful ####<neg><score>-2.2
Its okay ####<pos><score>0.2
There arent a lot of kids movies out right now so ####<neu><score>0.0
Nothing to rush out and see ####<neg><score>-0.4
But lack you know very lackluster ####<neg><score>-2.2
And i guess normally shrek is for adults ####<neu><score>0.0
Save your money wait til it comes out on rental ####<neg><score>-2.0
There were a few funny lines ####<pos><score>0.6
For me it was a waste of time ####<neg><score>-2.6
The movie theatre gave me credit to a future movie so that i appreciate it ####<pos><score>1.25
But after an hour i just said enough i had to walk out ####<neg><score>-2.4
Uh if you didnt like that type of movie then i really dont think youre gonna like this at all ####<neg><score>-1.6
Uh if you like the kind of movie that ben stiller did a night at the museum then you probably would like something uh like this ####<pos><score>1.4
But uh theres definitely far better movies that you can uh go see than um tongue clicking than zookeeper ####<neg><score>-1.6
And youre better off saving your money uh and maybe renting it when it comes out on uh video so ####<neg><score>-1.6
The picture quality was really great ####<pos><score>2.0
I will even pick up this movie on bluray ####<pos><score>1.8
I will even pick up this movie on bluray um anyways um the movie for me is three starts out of five stars three solid stars ####<pos><score>2.2

But it was really good ####<pos><score>2.2
Nine ninety screening plus i am number four you cant go wrong with that ####<pos><score>2.25
But i went and i dig this movie ####<pos><score>1.0
I was not looking forward to see this movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Plus i had a good time ####<pos><score>1.4
I was happy to see it ####<pos><score>1.8
The soundtrack is good its really good some really great songs ####<pos><score>2.4
Im wanting to talk about the good things about this movie ####<pos><score>0.4
Um anyways the music is good ####<pos><score>1.4
And the best thing about that is that all two songs um well not all of them but some of the songs are not well well connected with the scenes ####<neg><score>-1.4
I really dig the special effects of this movie ####<pos><score>2.6
Its stuttering that is a good thing ####<pos><score>1.25
Amazing special effects ####<pos><score>2.2
Like in the middle of the movie it starts with really great action sequences ####<pos><score>1.8
Its it was my favorite part of the movie ####<pos><score>0.8
And the ending was really really great too ####<pos><score>2.6
I mean the blood is like twilight with some scifi with some action and with likable characters and that that is important guys ####<pos><score>1.6
The main problem of this movie is that this movie is so cheesy ####<neg><score>-2.0
Not like the characters of of twilight ####<neu><score>0.0
The characters of i am number four are likable ####<pos><score>2.0
The likable characters make this movie a really good movie ####<pos><score>1.4
The acting is its normal its not bad its not bad at all ####<pos><score>0.4
So yeah if you want to have fun this weekend go watch it watch this movie ####<pos><score>2.4
Cause its worth it ####<pos><score>0.8
Im willing to go with friends alone with family to watch on a rainy day and if you can watch it at half price at a midnight show screening ####<pos><score>0.4
But they took a new spin on it ####<pos><score>1.4
And i just loved it ####<pos><score>2.6
And i feel like even though the fighting sequences were a little bit long in some places t ####<neg><score>-0.6
So i meant if i was wearing 3d glasses and was seeing this in 3d i wouldve enjoyed it a lot more ####<neg><score>-0.4
And just different ####<pos><score>0.2
It engages the audience more ####<pos><score>1.8
And i just really enjoyed it ####<pos><score>2.0
The green hornet did something similar ####<neu><score>0.0
And i would want the sequences to be even longer rather than shorter ####<pos><score>0.2
But i can safely assure you that even if they didnt it would still be a hit ####<pos><score>2.4
I dont know if fans of the comic would be as inclined to say the same because i dont know how much it differs from the comic or radio program that people like so much ####<neg><score>-0.2
And i loved it ####<pos><score>3.0
And i would tell you right now it was hilarious ####<pos><score>3.0
But just going into this a as an observer and someone who has no idea it was a fantastic film it was so much fun ####<pos><score>3.0
And most of you know hes a pretty funny guy ####<pos><score>1.8
It was really really funny ####<pos><score>2.8
So that doesnt surprise me ####<pos><score>0.6
And he funnied up this movie big time totally ####<pos><score>2.6
I feel like if they woudlnt have inserted the humor into this movie it wouldve been just too serious and kind of boring in a sense ####<pos><score>0.4
And the humor it was kind of necessary ####<pos><score>1.0
And the action sequences in this movie are tensed ####<pos><score>2.6
But the humor really just nailed it ####<pos><score>2.6
When they just come up with these totally completely new stylized ways of developing action sequences ####<pos><score>1.6
I love when people do this ####<pos><score>2.2
But when they figure out a new way to interpret this ####<neg><score>-0.25
Coz sure its fun to see a super hero go round and kick bad guy butt you know punch kick whatever bam ####<pos><score>0.8
That makes it more visually truly appealing ####<pos><score>1.4
And add something like an extra spark in there ####<pos><score>0.8
The acting could be better and is very medio ####<neg><score>-1.2
There is some sort of greatness to sucker punch though ####<pos><score>1.6
First the visual effects here are stellar ####<pos><score>2.6
They are unique ####<pos><score>2.8
But they you know they they bring nothing to this table ####<neg><score>-2.4
And which hurts the film drastically ####<neg><score>-2.2
Because they are interesting characters ####<pos><score>2.0
And could have interesting back stories ####<pos><score>0.8
Incredible icandy ####<pos><score>1.0
And just overall superb ####<pos><score>2.6
Browning is mediocre role ####<neg><score>-2.2
She isnt terrible ####<neg><score>-0.6
Theres never a feeling of star quality with her ####<neg><score>-1.2
Like the average horror film the uninvited ####<neu><score>0.0
But quite frankly she is implausible ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i dont know why people are hating on the film because i really do love it ####<pos><score>2.2
And visually stunning ####<pos><score>2.8
And is upstaged by many other performances in the film ####<neg><score>-0.2
Overall browning is just fails to deliver ####<neg><score>-2.4
The hits include oscar isaak as the main villain like i said blue jena malone is the soft spoken rocket and the stealing abby cornish is sweet pea a troubled and reluctant young woman in the pack ####<pos><score>0.8
The supporting cast is either hit or miss ####<neg><score>-0.2
Who doesnt have any presents or greatness at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
The misses include you know vanessa hudgens ####<neg><score>-0.4
Whos accent is so aweful ####<neg><score>-2.8
And the other horrible i mean absolutely atrocious carla gugino as doctor vera gorski ####<neg><score>-3.0
And her character is also undeveloped and weak ####<neg><score>-1.8
And whos is ridiculous ####<neg><score>-0.4
And they could have great back stories ####<neg><score>-0.2
Jon hamm and scott glenn could bring you know they could be interesting characters ####<pos><score>0.4
And the action in the movie is so well used ####<pos><score>2.8
Now let just get into two things that will possibly attract you to this film the violence and the 3d ####<pos><score>0.4
Its a joke really ####<neg><score>-2.4
The violence here is pretty bad ####<neg><score>-2.0
Viewers please resist from these two ####<neg><score>-1.5
The tire decapitation might not sound all that unique ####<neu><score>0.0
Therere about two creative scenes in here um one being in intestinal journey through the rectum in a swimming pool drain and a tire decapitation that ####<neg><score>-0.4
I mean not the sick like oh my god that was awesome ####<pos><score>1.0
But the way its pulled off its like wow that was sick ####<pos><score>2.2
Theres many different ways of saying sick nowadays ####<neg><score>-0.25
No sick in the oh my god that was crazy that kind of sick ####<neg><score>-0.8
But um yeah wow agh say that in two shee two scenes death isnt even nearly unique is a bit harsh ####<neg><score>-0.2
Its bad ####<neg><score>-3.0
Im not even gonna go to the lows to make a whole night video about this movie ####<neg><score>-1.2
Oh god this is bad ####<neg><score>-3.0
I hate it ####<neg><score>-2.8
So no now know this i am not a fan of the final destination series ####<neg><score>-2.4
But as far as im concerned this series is garbage ####<neg><score>-2.6
I might have to watch the first two again or maybe just the first one to stabilize my thoughts on the series ####<neu><score>0.0
Now i wont even talk about acting coz its just so bad ####<neg><score>-2.8
You can sense my excitement when i heard this was being released ####<neg><score>-0.5
The race stadium scene and the mall scenes in the beginning and the end where massive amounts of people die in the craziest ways are pretty good for late night buddy viewing you see you know what i mean by late night buddy viewings ####<pos><score>2.2
So it was just a little awkward ####<neg><score>-1.0
So it was just a little awkward ####<neg><score>-0.6
But um weve overcome that ####<pos><score>1.0
You know a lot of people have been talking about the expendables even though it came out such a long time agao ####<neu><score>0.0
My boyfriend got really excited when i told him we were gonna go see the expandables ####<pos><score>2.0
And than um when i went to blockbuster and i picked it up and i brought it back home he got really disappointed ####<neg><score>-1.0
I think its because it was such a moving film ####<pos><score>2.0
And i dont think he knows how to handle his emotions in that department ####<neg><score>-1.0
Theres been a lot of buzz about it lately and everyones you know a lot of controversy over it ####<neg><score>-0.4
Everyones been saying its really intense ####<pos><score>0.4
And i was unbelievably shocked how much i loved it ####<pos><score>3.0
Great dialogue ####<pos><score>2.0
It was full of action ####<pos><score>1.6
Its really just a heart warming story ####<pos><score>1.4
The characters were so great and well developed ####<pos><score>2.4
Its not that violent ####<neg><score>-0.2
Its a great movie to see over and over again your whole family can see it ####<pos><score>2.4
I really realy felt for the dad in the expendables ####<pos><score>1.0
Xxx it is a teenytiny bit violent and not enough so you can bring your 5 year old ####<neu><score>0.0
The dad was just really protective ####<pos><score>1.8
Because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a bend of outsiders and thay have all those powers ####<pos><score>1.2
Very heart warming ####<pos><score>2.2
And he made sure that hes whole family was safe ####<pos><score>1.4
Brad bird is a great writer and director ####<pos><score>2.6
Very touching ####<pos><score>2.0
It was so cute ####<pos><score>2.4
Um i think that my favorite part of the entire movie was when you find out at the end that the little baby had powers ####<pos><score>2.2
I really recommend you all see the expendables ####<pos><score>2.4
Just the great great movie ####<pos><score>3.0
There are parts that are very intense ####<neu><score>0.0
I can see that ####<pos><score>0.5
I know you guys are gonna love it ####<pos><score>2.8
So go see the expendables ####<pos><score>2.0
But for the most part it is a family friendly warm and fuzzy movievoovie ####<pos><score>1.0
It just it felt kind of cut and dry ####<neg><score>-1.4
Which would start the planning that i wish it has happened earlier in their careers ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i dont know if this scene took place fefteen twenty years ago when those guys were absolutely prime it wouldve been just um absolutely breath taking monumental moment in cinematic history ####<neg><score>-0.6
But seeing it today now when it was really nothing more than just a one xxx ship ####<neg><score>-1.2
It lost a lot of feeling ####<neg><score>-1.8
It wasnt the final you know finally happened u uniting that we all come to expect ####<pos><score>0.8
And its really what you wouldve expact ####<neg><score>-0.2
Theres little to no character development all movie ####<neg><score>-2.4
Its not a compelling narrative by any means ####<neg><score>-2.2
And really theres no humongous tale to these guys ####<neg><score>-1.2
And yet this movie is incredibly enjoyable for action fans ####<pos><score>2.2
But you know what you dont need a complecated formula for an action movie ####<neg><score>-1.0
Not a complicated story ####<neg><score>-0.4
This movie essentially was made for three reasons in my opinion ####<neg><score>-0.25
Theres a bad guy guy go take him down thats really all you need ####<neu><score>0.0
And thats you know all thats all you really needed to do ####<neg><score>-0.2
The first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film ####<pos><score>1.6
The second reason this movie was made and in my opinion the real reason it was made again its silvestre stalone telling himself i still got it ####<neg><score>-1.2
And definatelly comes through on that ####<pos><score>1.2
Hes in terrific shape for a man twice my age who looks significantly better than me ####<pos><score>2.2
Um ive got to give him credit ####<pos><score>1.0
But hey whatever and is showing yeah maybe hes not what he was twenty twenty five years ago but he still has every right to be billed as an action star ####<pos><score>1.2
Thats kind of made me feel depressed ####<neg><score>-1.6
Because you know its basically it was stalone knowing these guys arent in the shape they were twenty twenty five years ago ####<pos><score>1.2
Theres actually yeah yeah scenes triple stand off with silvestre arnold swarzeneger bruce willis and yeah actually in a way kind of fell hollow ####<neg><score>-1.0
I mean you dont see why these two people love each other ####<neg><score>-0.8
And it is very rushed ####<neg><score>-1.2
Like they have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together ####<neg><score>-1.2
Theres no character development really with these two ####<neg><score>-2.0
You dont see why they should like each other cause they dont show it in the movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Theres no reason why they should be together ####<neg><score>-2.0
And i thought this movie was gonna be really good because matt damon was in it ####<neg><score>-0.75
Like they talk for like five minutes and instantly kiss which is dumb ####<neg><score>-1.8
And i was really disappointed ####<neg><score>-2.6
But they did not execute it very well ####<neg><score>-2.2
What i liked about this movie was the concept was cool ####<pos><score>2.0
This movie is terrible for these reasons ####<neg><score>-3.0
And they left a lot of plot holes ####<neg><score>-2.0
You dont feel that these two people love each other ####<neg><score>-1.4
Number one because the love is forced ####<neg><score>-1.2
And he was still boring ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um yeah the special effects were ok ####<neu><score>0.0
Nothing thats worth going to theaters to see ####<neg><score>-2.6
And yeah i think the only character who actually showed their motivation bihind anything they did was the villain ####<neg><score>-1.8
And than cameron diaz whos supposed to be plucky i guess but shes just kinf of useless ####<neg><score>-1.8
Hi im pretty i have a giant smile im supposed to know thingsum walk of screen ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um yeah the characters didnt care weather they lived or died ####<neg><score>-2.4
Kato was the only one that was any good whatsoever ####<neg><score>-0.6
He was the only character that was slightly interesting ####<neg><score>-0.8
Who seemed to have genuine affection for other human beings ####<pos><score>0.6
Oh my gosh bad movie ####<neg><score>-2.8
I wish i werent ####<neg><score>-0.8
Really bad movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
But basically seth rogan brought none of the charm that he normally does to his roles ####<neg><score>-2.2
Because i truly love an action flick action comedy flick even better right ####<pos><score>1.6
Yeap a horrible protagonist ####<neg><score>-3.0
In fact i have to say that this was one of those obnoxious main characters ive seen a long time ####<neg><score>-2.6
And unlike other films for they kind of a narcisstic xxx boy but they bring something to the table you know ####<neg><score>-0.4
He um had all the charm of a narcissist xxx boy the whole film ####<neg><score>-2.8
Youre like oh theyre still kind of cool ####<pos><score>1.0
Theres something that just kind of makes tham so sl slightly endearing even though theyre kind of the jack ass you know ####<pos><score>0.8
Um hes just a jack ass ####<neg><score>-2.6
No no hes unfunny not funny at all ####<neg><score>-2.8
Boring ####<neg><score>-2.4
Um kato kicks ass handsome guy ####<pos><score>1.2
Just like look away what he can do he can do lots of stuff ####<neg><score>-1.4
Hes boring ####<neg><score>-2.0
You cant even tell funny jokes ####<neg><score>-1.8
What wa what hes what w why you have no skills whatsoever ####<neg><score>-2.25
I mean the only character that shows genuine care for other people be the villain ####<neg><score>-1.4
And it was kind of interesting ####<pos><score>1.2
Dont see it ####<neg><score>-1.8
Hmm yeah skip it ####<neg><score>-2.2

Oh god why did i watch that movie ####<neg><score>-2.8
I just got back from the movie theaters to go see a movie ive been waiting probably about a year and a half to two years for ####<pos><score>2.2
You know of course i was waithing for the princess and the frog ####<pos><score>1.0
If you are as big a fan of disney as i am ####<pos><score>2.5
And oh oh my gosh i was blown away ####<pos><score>2.8
I had some high exp o maybe not high expectations per se but i was definately expecting this to be a good movie ####<pos><score>0.6
It was incredible see all the different color palettes smooth hand drawn animation you know ####<pos><score>3.0
Anyway oh you can see im still speechless this movie was just beautiful ####<pos><score>2.8
So um i guess people just want to see um computer animated films from now on ####<neg><score>-0.2
They arent doing so well brother bear ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um fred dukes is the blob ####<neu><score>0.0
But in this oh my god i love you ####<pos><score>2.5
And you probably did the best portrayal of sabre tooth ever ####<pos><score>1.6
Although i do agree that the look could have been changed to fit the actual sabre tooths like with the right hair ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um we i love the scene where sabre tooth throws wolverine into the truck that feel good jackoff ####<pos><score>1.4
Probably widely considered to be one of the failed one of the most failed movies of the xmen franchise ####<neg><score>-2.6
Im pretty sure the first time it happend you would be kinda freaked out the whole time you know ####<neg><score>-1.0
First of all id like to say little wolver james or jimmy hes so cute hes so xxx ####<pos><score>3.0
Thats freaking epic ####<pos><score>2.0
Sigh i love when they show all the the war scenes all the the time they spent in the military and shit ####<pos><score>1.6

I love the name wade ####<pos><score>1.8
Laughing he certainly doesnt fit the bill either for any marvel movie um zero ####<neg><score>-1.0
I love him as an actor based on his looks as a actual talented actor no ####<neg><score>-1.0
Same with um wades uh sword scene where hes like sound effects its freaking epic ####<pos><score>2.0
After he busts all his caps in the air and rans and all the dead bodies fall around him fucking sick ####<pos><score>2.2
The random bitch that nobody knows where the fuck she came from why marvel why do you insist on torturing me ####<neg><score>-2.6
Um lip smacking sigh hm marvel once again decided to toss another random bitch in this movie wolverines bitch ####<neg><score>-1.2
He was fucking epic ####<pos><score>2.4
Lip smacking anyway lip smacking i love sabre tooth in this movie ####<pos><score>3.0
Ive never seen him in anything else ####<pos><score>0.2
Lieb schriever or however the fuck you say his name is a fucking tremendously awesome actor ####<pos><score>2.6
And and we kind of wanted it to be like but exept not that obvoious but that wouldve been good right like coz that it would give tham a reason coz they wanted to get married but they couldnc because she was gonna marry the other guy ####<pos><score>0.2
And another thing the other guy she was supposed to marry was a hundred times better looking than peter ####<neg><score>-1.2
Was nicer than peter ####<pos><score>0.6
I was saying if shes not gonna marry him i will ####<pos><score>0.8
Um a i wish we wished that it wouldve been um the guy ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um we wished it wouldve been peter because it wouldve made sense throat cleaning that um peter ####<neg><score>-0.6
Like we wanted to be that she knew um amanda seyfrieds character knew it was peter but was pretending that she didnt so that she got a reason to run away with him and they could be together ####<pos><score>0.2
And it would make sense ####<pos><score>0.4
Because i thought he was um peter was annoying ####<neg><score>-2.2
I didnt like peter ####<neg><score>-1.4
Xxx seeing red riding hood for a really long time ####<pos><score>1.0

And she was kind of wierd during twilight ####<neg><score>-1.0
And um i liked you know catherine hardwicke is like you know kind of ridiculous ####<neg><score>-0.6
So the more like women directors that i see you know i i i like seeing that ####<pos><score>1.2
But um i i like seeing um female directors because there arent that many compare to you know guy directors ####<pos><score>1.4
Um anyway i would say just you go and see it if you were thinking about seeing it but you werent sure if it would be worth seeing ####<pos><score>1.4
So um i thought she did great with this movie ####<pos><score>2.0
Um i hm i dont like well i dont know if i wanna say i dont like this but i wish that it wouldve been different who the wolf actually turned out to be ####<neg><score>-1.0

And he i dont i think he maybe he got mad when hah i dont know ####<neg><score>-0.25
This credit sequence i think is the best credit sequence um since watchman ####<pos><score>2.4
Um its basically a um slow motion show case of different events ####<pos><score>0.4
Yeah it really is good i mean ####<pos><score>2.2
And i honestly think if we hadnt have seen watchman this would be the best credit sequence of the year ####<pos><score>2.0
The sequences of the beginning of the film which features columbus exzplaining some of his rules um to surviving a zombie apocalipse are really well done ####<pos><score>2.6
It uses um and this just doesnt apply to the um um credit se sequence on it own but appies to the movie as a whole it really knows how to use s slow motion without making it a gimmick ####<pos><score>2.0
But its a very kind of um stylistic edge on it ####<pos><score>1.6
The xxx sequence is really well done ####<pos><score>2.0
And the style of the film like the um the free streams of slow motion the um the jump cooks and all that stuff feels very kind of um tarantino ask ####<pos><score>0.2
It its almost like um imagining tarantino directed a zombie movie ####<pos><score>0.8
Who have named themselves after the places um to which they have traveled in which i think is a really nice xxx ####<pos><score>2.0
The um cross of personality is really um charismatic and dynamic ####<pos><score>2.0
Now columbos is a basically um ocd ####<neu><score>0.0
Zombieland is a really sucessful horror comedy ####<pos><score>2.2
Um it just goes to show that you really cant trust anyone in this situation ####<neg><score>-1.0
And um while also maintains its kind of detached um satire of the genre ####<pos><score>0.4
As it contains um rea really well done and faithful homages to the zombie horror sub ganre ####<pos><score>1.6
Because um you really wanna see it for yourself ####<pos><score>1.4
But its really well done ####<pos><score>2.2
I dont know why i even saw it ####<neg><score>-1.4

If award for the great characters of shrek in his supporting cast they are still voiced by the original stars mike myers eddie murphy cameron diaz and antonio banderas the film would be a real bust ####<neg><score>-1.2

Everything that happened in shrek 1 2 and 3 are wiped away ####<pos><score>1.2
They solved this dilemma by removing the past within its a wonderful life twist courtecy of new betty rumpelstiltskin ####<neg><score>-0.4
But also not very original ####<neg><score>-2.0
Not a bad idea for a sequel ####<pos><score>0.8

I dont need the added element of katrina ####<neg><score>-1.8
They just need to cut that out ####<neg><score>-0.8
The the movies is too long ####<neg><score>-2.0
Th we do not need the entire span birth to death ####<neg><score>-1.6
Another thing is we dont need his entire life ####<neg><score>-1.8
And scale it down on like two hours ####<neg><score>-1.2
Just give me a nice interesting choke ####<pos><score>1.2
Um and if youre gonna do mostly cgi just make an animated movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
This also falls in to the trandy is very popular these days if you do a whole all of cgi ####<neg><score>-1.0
Makes him look too too good ####<neg><score>-0.6
This looks like it just has a polyurethane coating on it ####<neg><score>-1.0
My neighbor probably thinks im crazy yelling about movies to a camera ####<neg><score>-1.0
Now i didnt really like the first hour that much though ####<neg><score>-0.4
But i think this one did beat scream 2 ####<pos><score>1.2
I think xxx i want to see it ####<pos><score>1.6
Im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically ####<neg><score>-0.8
Im just kinda like no this is going to far ####<neg><score>-1.0
But it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent ####<neg><score>-1.0
So you better appreciate this review ####<pos><score>0.25
Theyre back to you having two killers thankfully ####<pos><score>0.8
But to any of you who are i expect a thumbs up ####<pos><score>1.4
Hmph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than scream 3 ####<pos><score>1.2
Because it does make a lot more sense having the killer be able to be everywhere if theres two of them ####<pos><score>0.5
A lot of people dont like scream 2 ####<neu><score>0.0
And actually is better than scream 2 ####<pos><score>1.6
I hated scream 3 ####<neg><score>-2.4
I think its highly underrated ####<pos><score>0.8
And later time she goes like a world war ii battlefield um castle this kind of pulled out of lord of the rings ####<neg><score>-0.2
In fact the first time she goes in it looks like a japanese temple ####<neu><score>0.0
Its kind of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the matrix films did ####<pos><score>0.2
Whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that way ####<neu><score>0.0
Although actually the best comparison this is this film would actually be something like pans labyrinth ####<neu><score>0.0
It only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed ####<neg><score>-0.4
That i got very little joy out of ####<neg><score>-2.2
But unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent unvolving and sadistic exercise ####<neg><score>-2.8
Thats pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence ####<neu><score>0.0
In fact i got mostly pain out of it ####<neg><score>-2.8
Now it also takes so really creepy xxxof the fact that emily browning in this movie looks like shes underage ####<neg><score>-1.0
When she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in the vocation that she obviously doesnt wanna be in ####<neg><score>-0.2
That kind of looks like video game in a certain way ####<neg><score>-0.4
But i dont know ####<neg><score>-0.5
So i will give it points for not being exactly like my best friends wedding even at the trailer sets it up that way ####<pos><score>1.0
And we second guess ourselves ####<neu><score>0.0
But i dont think shes leading material ####<neg><score>-2.0
Ginnifer goodwin is fun to watch ####<pos><score>1.8
If there is any silverlining in this movie its john krasinski ####<pos><score>0.6
And like i said kate hudson couldnt be more annoying here ####<neg><score>-1.2
But he has some of the funniest scenes in this movie ####<pos><score>1.6
Who i dont usually like ####<neu><score>0.0
He seems to be the only realistic character here ####<neg><score>-1.0
Its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread ####<neg><score>-2.6
Annoyingly she kind of yells and screams through the whole movie ####<neg><score>-1.25
Now the real star of something borrowed is ginnifer goodwin ####<pos><score>1.2
Um it kind of follows the path of my best friends wedding 1997 julia roberts movie except it takes thirty minutes longer to deviate from the scripts of my best friends wedding ####<neg><score>-0.4
And if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any batter ####<neg><score>-2.0
But mostly its just kate hudson being very annoying ####<neg><score>-1.6
There are some funny moments ####<pos><score>0.2
I think with with these kind of movies we kind of predict ####<pos><score>0.4
And i think its predictable up an to a point ####<neg><score>-1.0
But i kinda would have read that been like hm i mean schwarzanegger never said anything really that badass in his movies ####<neg><score>-1.0
But arite and moving on theres no character development in this movie none ####<neg><score>-2.0
Well i can tell you right now i dont remember the names of any characters none of them were memborable ####<neg><score>-2.0
And they were all just really bland and forgettable ####<neg><score>-2.0
Everything they say just sounds so fucking stupid ####<neg><score>-2.2
The only actor who can really sell their lines is erin eckart ####<neg><score>-1.0
There are moments where he says something youre like that just sounded dumb as hell ####<neg><score>-2.4
But he totally sells it ####<pos><score>1.2
The action is fucking awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
Its very reminscent of district ####<neu><score>0.0
The action is really really well directed ####<pos><score>2.6
But it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did ####<neg><score>-1.2
9 its like someone watched the third act of district 9 a bunch of times like lets make this into an entire movie itll be awesome and thats pretty much what they did here ####<neg><score>-1.6
I didnt really see a comparison to black hawk down until like the very very end ####<neg><score>-0.6
In fact this movie isnt even on the same level as district 9 nor is it um for uh black hawk down which people are comparing it to ####<neg><score>-1.6
The aliens are really awesome ####<pos><score>2.8
But nevertheless another really cool thing about this movie ####<pos><score>1.8
And they have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know ####<pos><score>2.4
They designed the aliens in a really cool unique way to make them like biotic but also mechanical ####<pos><score>2.4
But its not always quite explained you know like everything about the aliens ####<neg><score>-0.6
And they always like pull out something new ####<pos><score>0.5
Like enough that it actually is a good reason why they why theyre attacking ####<pos><score>1.33333333333
But they give you a good amount of information about them ####<pos><score>0.8
Uh the dialogue is terrible ####<neg><score>-2.8
And it keeps your interests in the action scenes at least during this movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Nothing in this movie is cleverly written ####<pos><score>2.2
There is no good dialogue ####<neg><score>-2.4
But it does have some adult humour ####<pos><score>0.6
Those are quote in this movie that sounded so dirty coming out ####<neg><score>-0.2
But it as great ####<pos><score>2.0
Yes um something about waffle hole am i the only one am i perverted not to think that that sounds dirty coz it totally does waffle hole ####<neg><score>-0.8
The third one was more kid humour though ####<pos><score>0.4
It didnt have that much adult humour in it ####<neg><score>-0.2
Um yeah the fourth one it does have kid humour definatelly ####<pos><score>0.4
Its a kids movie ####<neg><score>-0.2
It had me laughing out loud ####<pos><score>2.0
And i dont think that many other people were laughing about it ####<neg><score>-0.75
Which i was not excited to see ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i have to admit i i like shrek i do ####<pos><score>0.8
And it actually surprised me ####<pos><score>1.2
Um theyve become quite a bit overrated ####<neg><score>-1.33333333333
I like the first two shreks quite a bit ####<pos><score>1.0
The third one was a piece of crap ####<neg><score>-2.4
But the first two were pretty excellent ####<pos><score>2.0
Um which actually was really good ####<pos><score>1.8
And thats why i was not excited about the fourth one ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i i did enjoy it ####<pos><score>0.5
I did like the fourth one quite a bit ####<pos><score>2.0
And it just was better ####<pos><score>0.6
It reminded me of the first one had the same kind of vibe like the first one ####<pos><score>0.2
Coz the first two were great and they brought in the kids and it made it more kiddy friendly movie ####<neg><score>-0.8
Maybe its the baby ogres maybe bringing in the baby ogres really brought it down ####<neg><score>-1.8
But they were had adult humour ####<pos><score>0.8
The first two were kid movies ####<pos><score>0.25
And would go over the kids heads and this is what the fourth one kind of has ####<neg><score>-0.6
I though that adults would appreciate ####<pos><score>0.4
Because my one of my cousins doesnt like the glasses ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um yeah its its better than the third one absolutely ####<pos><score>1.6
Like i dont understand ####<neg><score>-1.4
Like i i actually felt myself checking the time cuz i was like when is this movie going to end ####<neg><score>-2.4
I do not wanna see any more of this ####<neg><score>-2.8
And i tell i couldnt get out of that movie theatre fast enough ####<neg><score>-2.8
Um yeah so we were out for most of it we were talking about i was texting i just like i had absolutely the film had no draw to me ####<neg><score>-1.8
The beginning started off great with a couple good jokes ####<pos><score>1.8
And really funny uh animation stuff it was great really funny ####<pos><score>2.6
Um and then towards the middle it was like what is going on ####<neg><score>-2.4
Um in general um the little kids seemed to like it that were in there ####<pos><score>0.8
But the adults were the adults that were actually attempting to watch it and the people who were my age as well were like what did i just see ####<neg><score>-1.2
Yes when you hear johnny depp you think uh this movie has to be good ####<pos><score>0.2
It was really boring to me ####<neg><score>-2.4
Im not going to lie to you it wasnt good ####<neg><score>-2.2
I go for like the more oldies type type films i guess like the older pixar films like toy story and all that stuff ####<neg><score>-1.0
Chuckling i mean and i dont actually go and im not being biased because i dont really go for the animated type films ####<neg><score>-1.2
Laughing you know a movies terrible when a person trying to review it doesnt even know what to say but i dont know this movie was ####<neg><score>-2.8
Um but this one was uh i dont know i mean the story was there but sigh i dont know ####<neg><score>-1.4
But it was just it was like im not gonna even lie to you guys i fell asleep around the middle of it and woke up like what just happened ####<neg><score>-2.6
Uh johnny depp doing the voice was fantastic ####<pos><score>2.6
It wasnt there ####<neg><score>-1.8
Um its one of those movies where most of the funny parts are in the commercial you know youve seen the commercial so many times that that part isnt even funny anymore and then youre wondering where the hell is the rest of it ####<neg><score>-2.2
The voice acting was phenomenal ####<pos><score>2.8
It just wasnt it di did not work for me ####<neg><score>-2.0
It was so bad i just did not enjoy it ####<neg><score>-2.8
But the the actual story line was just terrible ####<neg><score>-2.2
Im not even kidding i went with a bunch of friends and a movies supposed to be ten times better when youre with a bunch of friends ####<neg><score>-1.8
Uh i will i will actually say this right now it was a good waste of like 12 ####<pos><score>0.2
And the two others were just bored ####<neg><score>-1.8
And uh my friend next to me fell asleep ####<neg><score>-1.4
I uh jesus i dont know it was sigh its sad though because i expected so much mo ####<neg><score>-2.0
Miranda miranda was always one of the best characters ####<pos><score>1.2
And let me tell you it surpassed itself ####<pos><score>1.2
This movie isnt just bad its diabolical ####<neg><score>-1.8
It reached the new hights of horrendous ####<neg><score>-2.4
Also if youre a streight man and you voluntarily willingly goo and see this film im gonna need you to light a candle say a prayer and ask yourself some questions ####<neg><score>-1.4
First let me just say i saw quite a few guys at the cinema who clearly been dragged there by the girlfriends and to those guys i say would you like me to sew your balls back on for you ####<neg><score>-2.2
Where the problem with that lies not entirely sure ####<neg><score>-1.2
This is really just a continuation of the first film ####<neu><score>0.0
I dont know if charlotte started on made me never want to have kids or never want to have rich friends ####<neg><score>-1.4
Let me see if i can rustle up some symphaty yeah ive got nothing ####<neg><score>-2.2
And he delivers a lot of intensity ####<pos><score>1.6
He is average ####<pos><score>0.2
And its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there ####<neg><score>-1.4
Uh stormshadow is very cool ####<pos><score>2.0
His fight sequences are very neat ####<pos><score>2.0
And he really seems to be channeling michael bay in this movie ####<neu><score>0.0
And its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions ####<pos><score>0.8
The plot has the consistency of swiss cheese ####<neg><score>-1.6
I feel like it almost should have had a g rating ####<neg><score>-0.4
Sigh all in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i hate to say that ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was really kind of dumb down for us ####<neg><score>-1.4
But if you are a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much ####<neg><score>-2.2
I think you will really love this movie if you are 8 ####<pos><score>2.0
And all i can is hes a pretty average guy ####<neu><score>0.0
Because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place ####<neg><score>-1.0
Marlon wayans kind of plays a watered down version of himself from other movies ####<neg><score>-1.0
I dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
And hes pretty average too ####<neg><score>-0.6
He does some stereotypical things like talking uh about busting a cap while flying an airplane ####<pos><score>0.2
And so thats pretty entertaining ####<pos><score>1.6
The two women in this movie are particularly good looking ####<pos><score>1.4
And his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time ####<neg><score>-2.0
This is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies ####<pos><score>1.2
It was cute you know the actors did a great job bringing the smurfs to life such as joe george lopez neil patrick harris katy perry and a fourth ####<pos><score>0.8
Other than that it was a good movie ####<pos><score>1.25
But i had a few problems so i didnt love it i liked it ####<pos><score>1.25
It was a great movie and i loved it ####<pos><score>2.8
Three stars for smurfs and stay smurfy everyone ####<pos><score>0.8
But it was a good movie ####<pos><score>1.2
Only because it was very predictable very predictable ####<neg><score>-1.2
Id give it three stars ####<pos><score>1.0
That um i guess the only other problem i had with it was that um the jokes were really cheesy ####<neg><score>-1.8
But very predictable ####<neg><score>-1.5
So if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie ####<pos><score>0.6
I dont like cheesy jokes but cheesy jokes are most times funny cuz theyre really bad ####<neu><score>0.0
Beyond this age the problem i had with the movie theatre is there were kids crying the whole time and whispering xxx does baby crying get on your nerves ever if it does wouldnt recommend going to this movie cuz theres a bunch of kids or sneak into a really late showing cuz i dont think kids are going to be out that late but thats the only problem i had with it ####<neg><score>-1.4
I would definitely take 8 or younger kids to that movie its a definite family movie ####<pos><score>0.6
Although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense ####<pos><score>0.6
But its just a little weak overall for me than we were looking forward to him and he was gone quickly ####<neg><score>-1.6
Just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
He co laurence fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers shouldve known about which gives a little more of f fony feel this whole thing ####<neg><score>-2.0
It dosent give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie ####<neg><score>-1.4
Its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters ####<neg><score>-2.0
In finale i would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sequal to the 87th version and only if you like the series ####<neg><score>-1.6
Nothing new is brought in those predator series no surprises no big twist no finish ####<neg><score>-2.4
Althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not ####<neg><score>-1.2
I like to tease some mystery and great plot what couldve been but than all is explained and disppeares ten minutes later its just a clear remake of predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical ####<neg><score>-1.8
You dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody ####<neg><score>-2.0
In the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalites this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly ####<neg><score>-2.2
But nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points i guess ####<pos><score>0.8
Of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them ####<neu><score>0.0
What disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time ####<neg><score>-2.0
I love my movies to be long ####<pos><score>2.0
This movie seemed um a little long ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um im passionate about movies so thats fine ####<pos><score>0.8
I dont think a movie can ever be too long um you know i like you know the dark night was you know two hours and forty five minutes you know and titanic you know all those movies a avatar all those movies that you know three hours and you know thats fine by me i love long movies ####<pos><score>1.8
Some parts just kind of dragged on you kind of you know sit in the movie theater and this is a big action movie one of the biggest movies of the summer and you kind of just wanted to you know rest your head while watched um coz some of the sequences and some of the scenes were just kind of long ####<neg><score>-2.2
But this one seemed long at some at some parts ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um the action was great you know not too much not too little just um just enough action ####<pos><score>2.0
And you just kind of like ok lets get to it we know whats gonna happen lets go ahead and do it ####<neg><score>-1.6
But pretty good script ####<pos><score>2.0
Um the story was all right ####<pos><score>0.8
I dont think it was as good as the first one obviously i i think the first movie was just fantastic ####<neg><score>-1.25
I went to this movie very very excited ####<pos><score>1.4
I think um the movies are phenomenal especially that first one ####<pos><score>2.8
Im a big transformers fan ####<pos><score>2.2
Um in interviews shia labeouf said that the second movie lacked um heart ####<neg><score>-1.4
Um i dont think that this ove got as much buzz and as much um media attention and um word of mouth you know spreading around and stuff ####<neg><score>-0.8
Um after watching this movie i dont really think thats necessarily true um i think that the second movie and the third movie are very very similar um i think they tried to add a lot of heart ####<neg><score>-1.0
And he said that this new one has a lot of heart um similar to the first one ####<pos><score>1.6
Theres too much too fast i mean we basically just get introduced to this character and you know right away um this is the first movie shes in and theyre already um you know um meant to be together forever and all that good slushy stuff ####<neg><score>-2.0
And it just seems like too much too fast i mean theyre already telling each other that love each other and talking about getting wedding rings spending the rest of their lives together they live together i mean its just way too much too fast they try to built their heart into it by you know him saying you know youre the only thing that matters in this world you know i dont care about myself you know coz she thinks hes doing crazy stuff sacrifizing his life in a then he does crazy stuff to save her and hes just like i love you you know just all the sappy blah blah stuff ####<neg><score>-2.2
Um maybe im part with the second one maybe im little behind that but it was it was pretty good story ####<pos><score>0.8
He looked awesome while he did it but yeah ok so let all the girls who want all disagree with me coz they all think this is an amazing movie but they all think he was amazing because they were staring at daniel craig the whole time theyr going oh my gosh hes so hot ####<pos><score>0.8
All the guys that went were pretty much on my page they were just like wow that was stupid wow ####<neg><score>-2.6
I sat with the guys and we all try to stay awake through it um and kept falling asleep and then talk about how stupid it was ####<neg><score>-2.2
The verdict is stupid and a complete waste of money ####<neg><score>-2.6
Like i didnt expect it to be good ####<neg><score>-0.8
But it was a fun experience going ####<pos><score>2.25
Aaaaa it wasnt even holding my attention ####<neg><score>-2.8
But its just such a waste of money for them like when i see the movie thats obviously had a very big budget and it is like not even good it makes me angry coz im just like why are you wasting so much money ####<neg><score>-2.4
I honestly wanted the aliens to win ####<neg><score>-0.4
I could barely stay awake through the movie ####<neg><score>-2.6
Just there was only one character the doctor he was the only person i even really cared about ####<neg><score>-1.4
All the characters were just so unlikable ####<neg><score>-1.6
Every single cowboy was just a complete douchebag ####<neg><score>-2.6
And even he was a douchebag all of them ####<neg><score>-2.6
But he wasnt even interesting ####<neg><score>-2.0
And there was just this little boy and he was the only person who wasnt a douchebag ####<neg><score>-1.0
He was just like a plot device for this other guy to start acting like a father figure and he was just stupid but then he didnt even act like a father figure towards him ####<neg><score>-1.6
But they gave him no no character like he had no character development whatsoever ####<neg><score>-2.6
Why are you killing everyone ####<neg><score>-1.6
But he was actually complete douchebag ####<neg><score>-1.8
Whay are you killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself ####<neg><score>-1.4
It just some people were like oh hes so cool hes so awesome like youve never seen that in the movie this person who had amnesia just kills everybody even if its like but that was so unnecessary ####<neg><score>-2.2
And then maybe even when she was happy like she wouldnt frown her um frown her eyebrows but shed still be pouty but like yeah like that ####<neg><score>-1.6
It was like this like pouty like grumpy look ####<neg><score>-1.8
Like those tho those those moments in the film especially in the beginning where she would sit there stand there cross um with her arms crossed and just look out into the distance like just laughing with the same expression or shed look across the beach or shed look at her dad or shed look at her brother with the same expression and i was just like whatre you thinking i i dont understand what this characters doing ####<neg><score>-2.0
Which just uh it really annoyed me ####<neg><score>-2.6
But as an actor i really think especially an actor in the lead leading role you really should prepare for that role ####<neg><score>-2.0
Like okay shes staring whats she thinking how does she feel i had no idea like it was the same expression for shock or for sadness or what i presumed shed be sad but it sigh it really bugged me ####<neg><score>-2.4
Smacking so thats probably why she just laughinglooked the same in every single scene there was probably about two scenes that i actually thought yea she this is her acting this is good she can do this ####<neg><score>-0.4
I was like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is ####<neg><score>-1.6
But then those two moments just got ruined by the rest of an hour and a half of her being pouty ####<neg><score>-2.2
Now i am a huge huge fan of nicholas sparks ####<pos><score>2.8
Um i really enjoyed a walk to remember me and dear john ####<pos><score>2.6
Um the notebook is one of my favorite films ####<pos><score>2.4
So i went into this film having quite high expectations ####<pos><score>0.4
I really did enjoy as well wasnt too fond of the ending ####<pos><score>1.4
But on the other hand i was really um wary of going ####<neg><score>-1.4
I mean its a nicholas sparks book it must be good ####<pos><score>1.25
Straight away miley cyrus acting miley cyrus acting or lack of she had this same expression throughout the entire film ####<neg><score>-1.0
Like what to expect from miley cyrus um i mean shes only done the hannah montana franchise playing that one character which i think like 99 of the percent of the time her characters like so overboard shes so exaggerated so i really didnt know how she was going to handle this film ####<neg><score>-1.2
I just hated it ####<neg><score>-2.8
I didnt think it was sad ####<neg><score>-0.4
Two out of five stars ####<neg><score>-1.6
Like seriously ####<neg><score>-1.0
I kind of have a um artistic video up on my main channel ####<pos><score>0.4
I guess im just over it ####<neg><score>-1.8
I love you guys ####<pos><score>0.8
Um ronny wanted to know what was the last movie we saw in theatres and to give a review for it ####<neu><score>0.0
I really did ####<pos><score>0.5
Um i think the last movie i saw in theatres was toy story 3 and i hated it ####<neg><score>-2.0
And i really hated cars ####<neg><score>-2.2
I think im getting to that point where im just not entertained by disney pixar movies anymore because i couldnt stand up ####<neg><score>-2.8
And i liked wally ####<pos><score>1.4
I liked finding nemo ####<pos><score>1.6
I didnt think it was cute ####<neg><score>-1.4
I didnt think it was funny ####<neg><score>-2.0
And uh although like i like dark humor ####<neg><score>-0.6
Smacking lips maybe only 5 jokes made me laugh ####<neg><score>-1.8
No i i i guess so i mean its its it wasnt annoying ####<neg><score>-0.8
But i just couldnt find it funny ####<neg><score>-2.2
Maybe a lot more than the expendables ####<pos><score>0.25
It it it was just there i i i i wasnt i wasnt amused ####<neg><score>-2.0
The action feels that its um it its its pretty much just uh quick cut or slash blood scream you know lip smacking ####<neg><score>-1.4
But i feel that the movie wasnt really concerned with being exciting ####<neg><score>-1.4
Still the the church shootout however brief that was it it was alright ####<pos><score>0.2
Fffflat shit lip smacking ####<neu><score>0.0
Maybe it could have been 20 seconds longer ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um id like to quickly talk about machete ####<neu><score>0.0
I couldnt get into it ####<neg><score>-2.0
Im sorry and disappointed to say this i didnt like it ####<neg><score>-2.0
And maybe planet terror im im not sure im just ####<neg><score>-0.8
I know it its not meant to be taken seriously maybe 70s exploitation movies are more cheesy than machete ####<neg><score>-0.8
I i cant explain why the humor was was mostly flat because a few or several jokes actually felt they they they actually felt felt funny ####<neg><score>-1.0
Sound of cars the action and humor were mostly flat ####<neg><score>-1.8

I think they are very good actors ####<pos><score>1.8
Jim carry ian mcgreggor i liked the two of them ####<pos><score>1.8
Because its um its an audience pleaser you know ####<pos><score>1.6

An especially when it comes to romantic dramas like thumping its uh it gets the audiences to theatres because its a compelling idea but its been uh done ####<pos><score>0.2
And i really really loved it ####<pos><score>2.0
And i was just thinking about um how its the performances in it were sort of over overlooked at the academy awards ####<pos><score>1.4
And i thought that the performances in it were incredible ####<pos><score>2.4
But there were a lot of great movies out this year ####<pos><score>1.2
Because um there were so many great movies that came out this year i mean um the kings speech black swan 127 hours inception ####<pos><score>2.2
And i think that blue valentine has um become kind of underrated ####<pos><score>1.4
Some of the great performances um of last year were kind of overlooked cuz there were just so many of them ####<pos><score>1.0
And theres a lots of smacking lips theres so many dynamics going on with this relationship and i think that it was it was a great story ####<pos><score>2.2
And its truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things ####<neg><score>-1.5
And i enjoyed myself a lot at the movie ####<pos><score>2.2
I laughed at quite a bit of the dialogue ####<pos><score>1.2
And there actually was one scene that i found kin ####<pos><score>0.6
But i do wanna tell you about priest ####<neu><score>0.0
If you like explosions really ridiculous action sequences malodramatic plot and acting this is the right movie to see ####<pos><score>2.2
If you were looking for a movie that has anything realistic in it you should not be looking at this movie because it is insane ####<neg><score>-2.4
And is fun to watch ####<pos><score>1.8
And she also has pretty sweet moves ####<pos><score>1.8
Therere also two lord of the rings grads which i absolutely love ####<pos><score>2.4
Some really fun touches within the movie is that two vampires in other shows appear in this movie not as vampires ####<pos><score>2.0
If all three of them were put together ####<neg><score>-0.25
And anyone who knows me knows the lord of the rings trilogy is probably my favorite movie ever ####<pos><score>2.6
Which basically means hes wormtongue again in a different way ####<neg><score>-0.2
Yeah thats about how my favorite list goes ####<pos><score>1.33333333333
And she is a really pretty girl ####<pos><score>2.4
Other notable mentiones are christopher plumber ####<pos><score>0.2
I really love the melodramatic over the top crazy action sort of thing going on ####<pos><score>2.6
This is one of my favorite types of movies ####<pos><score>2.0
And theres a better on top of the train fights than the first mission impossible movie ####<pos><score>1.4

And i xxx like in particular joseph joseph gordonlevitt had a lot of fun with his role ####<pos><score>1.4
I think um rachel nichols had a lot of fun with her role ####<pos><score>1.8
So i i think it was cool to actually see ray park in action great action star ####<pos><score>2.4
He does a great job with his snake eyes which is always cool to see that ####<pos><score>1.8
Because i really wanted to see it actually ####<pos><score>0.5
Or big collector of the action figures ####<neu><score>0.0
And um first of all i i actually was never a huge fan of the ji joe tv series ####<neg><score>-0.8
Ji joe rise of the cobra um this movie is incredible cheezy ####<pos><score>0.2
But i wasnt big on it um ####<pos><score>1.0
Yes it the acting is a little rough in some parts ####<neg><score>-1.2
But in the good way i in ist theres two types of cheezy and this is the good kind of cheezy ####<pos><score>1.8
But the m the script is corny ####<neg><score>-2.0
Well you know um corny ####<neg><score>-0.2
I mean i didnt go to this movie expecting to see the dark night ####<pos><score>0.4
I mean the way its written is corny ####<neg><score>-1.8
Because if ive seen it over the summer i probably wouldve rated it best action movie i saw this summer ####<pos><score>2.0
And quite honestly i wish ive seen this over the summer ####<pos><score>1.6
I did like transformers 2 even though a lot of people didnt like that ####<pos><score>2.0
This summer was kind of weird with the action movies if you ask me ####<neg><score>-0.8
And um you know you have a lot of good actors in this movie actually a lot of good actors ####<pos><score>2.0
But you know this movie um this really um wouldve made up for a disappointment that it had a terminator salvation ####<neg><score>-0.4
So you know its not like you actually getting like academy award quality acting performances ####<neg><score>-0.6
In you know theyre in there this is a cheezy um movie ####<neg><score>-1.0
Joe movie is how international it was it was very divert ####<pos><score>0.8
I would not take a young child ####<neg><score>-0.8
Except their eyes are kind of like this welcome to the polar express ####<neg><score>-0.6
And thats a lot to be said for a one minute review ####<pos><score>0.2
I actually like the film ####<pos><score>2.0
Um i enjoyed myself in it you might as well ####<pos><score>2.2
But let me first say this i liked it more than i expected i would ####<pos><score>0.8
Number one it means its much scarier than you could imagine ####<pos><score>0.75
This film is slavishly devoted to the original book or nov novella uh by uh charles dickens ####<pos><score>0.8
Let me say this if your christianity is extremely legalistic this is the film for you ####<pos><score>0.5
My 8 year old was terrified through part of this because the original version is terrifying ####<neg><score>-1.0
So laughing if thats your form of christianity its a christian film ####<neg><score>-0.2
Cause this is a film that basically says you know what you should do you should take care of poor people because jesus told us to take care of poor people and if you dont take care of poor people youre gonna burn in hell ####<neg><score>-1.2
Um another thing about this film is in its devotion is that sometimes my children could not understand what was being said because they were speaking dickensonian english ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um its not my form ####<neg><score>-1.5
Therefore a lot of social commentary goes woop sound effect over your head ####<neg><score>-1.4
Sometimes i missed what was being said ####<neg><score>-0.6
Um all this stuff about debtors prison for instance doesnt really um jive here in 21st century america ####<neg><score>-1.8
Or just really doesnt make any difference to us today at all ####<neg><score>-0.666666666667
Because this thing is is meant to be seen in 3d ####<pos><score>0.6
And this film is this amazing like i say slavish devotion to charles dickens with an amusement park ride ####<pos><score>2.2
Or most likely from going very quickly through london with you know demon horses chasing you so uh theres that ####<pos><score>0.2
And throughout the film youre going sound effects laughing either from the terrifying characters ####<pos><score>0.6
Um the people seemed sort of dead ####<neg><score>-1.6
Also about the animation the people just like in polar express a film i really did not like ####<neg><score>-2.0
I can appreciate that ####<pos><score>0.8
Hes not gonna be looking like a chipper bright young man but early thirties really you want me to buy that ####<neg><score>-1.8
I cant do it ####<neg><score>-1.6
Especially when hes hanging around with a married men who all but one of them are probably early twenties laughter and one of them is maybe mid twenties and meanwhile theyre hanging in with papa russel it just looks like you know its bunch of a guys hanging there so one brought dad along coz he offered to drive ####<neg><score>-1.2
Robin hood starring russel crow um first thing i got to say xxx i was dreading going in to see this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
So i really was not looking forward to seeing this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
The trailers werent really doing it much for me ####<neg><score>-1.2
But i didnt mind it ####<pos><score>0.4
Um but i guess say maybe my expectations were lowered by these other reviews that i read ####<neg><score>-0.2
I didnt find it all that good ####<neg><score>-1.8
But i didnt find it all that bad ####<neu><score>0.0
Like what people could hate about this movie there are some negatives to say the least ####<neg><score>-1.4
Like i said maybe my expectations were lowered because of all of those reviews but i really didnt hate it ####<pos><score>0.4
Theres men in tights which you know hilarious spoof of the story ####<pos><score>2.0
Um really first and foremost it just lacked the charm of these past robin hood movies that we know ####<neg><score>-2.0
And it just lacked the charm of those past movies ####<neg><score>-2.0
Theres a kevin costner prince of fee version which was supposed to be the dark and edgy version of his time i mean but that was what thirteen years ago fourteen years ago probably more than that ####<neg><score>-0.6
And it really just lacked what made the other movies more enjoyable ####<neg><score>-2.0
It did seem to focus too much on epic epic epic ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um not in all instances but the ones that matter the most yeah ####<neg><score>-0.6
And suffers from what i call kingdom of heaven syndrom where it builds too much for these huge catastrophic war sequences theyre supposed to blow you away but the problem is you dont give a damn because it just lacks that charm of the past movies ####<neg><score>-1.8
Like were supposed to believe that these two are in their mid wel you know mid thirties at the oldest and laughter theyre looking pretty rough in this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
Um russel crow and cate blanchette just did not sell it for me i had a very hard time just buying it ####<neg><score>-2.2
And not being really stressed out ####<neu><score>0.0
And i think that thats thats a very relatable issue ####<pos><score>1.0
I think that they all have like a lot of issues ####<neu><score>0.0
And that some are very relatable ####<pos><score>0.8
She does have a lot of issues ####<neg><score>-1.4
And you really can kind of symphatize whether youve got to have kids ####<pos><score>0.6
I mean even if you dont have kids ####<pos><score>0.6
Because its just just about getting getting time for yourself ####<neg><score>-0.5
Yeah i mean it it has some fun moments ####<pos><score>1.4
But all in all wasnt really that big of a fan ####<neg><score>-1.2
Im gonna start off with saying that i really wasnt very impressed with the movie ####<neg><score>-1.6
But this movie kind of came off like somebodys really sad travel video i dont know ####<neg><score>-1.6
And i liked the first movie i thought the first movie was really good ####<pos><score>1.6
But i just wasnt i just i dont know i didnt really like the movie all that much ####<neg><score>-2.2
I mean that sounds really harsh ####<neg><score>-1.6
And a few funny parts ####<pos><score>1.0
I mean i had some some good moments ####<pos><score>1.0
I dont know i just thought i just thought it was really really sad ####<neg><score>-1.0
But all in all i just thought it was really over overly sad ####<neg><score>-1.0
I just personally i just didnt really enjoy it ####<neg><score>-2.4
Um i mean if you really like the show and you really liked the first movie and you still wanna go and see this im not gonna discourage you from seeing it ####<pos><score>0.6
Like it couldve been shorter ####<neg><score>-1.0
Um it also really didnt need a lot of the things that it had in it ####<neg><score>-1.4
And i mean i dont know i just i feel like i dont mean if i have wasted those two hours i just feel like i couldve done something better with them ####<neg><score>-2.0
But a lot of the footage was kind of unnecessary ####<neg><score>-1.5
I really think that i really like the mirandas character ####<pos><score>1.75
I think that charlotte and miranda have some really nice moments in the movie ####<pos><score>1.8
I think that um and that everybody i do feel really bad for charlotte ####<neg><score>-0.8
Actually the most upbeat character in the whole movie ####<pos><score>0.6
Um like i said if you like it feel free to go see it i just personally wasnt that into it ####<neg><score>-1.0
Because there really wasnt all that much to it for me ####<neg><score>-2.0
Um so if you like to hear a um like more positive review check out her review it is very good ####<pos><score>0.6
And she really enjoyed the film ####<pos><score>1.2
If you do wanna see somebody whos possibly critiquing it ####<neg><score>-0.4

Which is kind of interesting ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632

That is what is one of the things that makes it so great ####<pos><score>2.0

That really translates so there has to be some great animators to do that ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632

Hey, Summer here for ExpoTV ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Now, the basic premise behind this movie is Nicolas Cage is a cop, and he's trying his best to find out what happened with a six-year-old crime ####<neu><score>0.0
The movie is eight millimeters with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix ####<neu><score>0.0
And in the process, he finds (umm) an integrated trail of mystery, murder, thrillers ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
So he is reinvestigating an old crime ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) I did not like the storyline of the movie, first of all ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And all of it is being captured on eight millimeter film ####<neu><score>0.0
It, it (stutter) was on film, and then (stutter) they showed you clips of these films ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) I I (stutter) liked even less the fact that there was actually on film violence, rape, and murder ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I mean, there can be, I've watched many, many psychological thrillers that were really, really good ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
And I I (stutter) wasn't, you know, thrilled with that ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I understand that the basis of the movie is the eight millimeter film basis, but it could have been done in a different way ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And they didn't need to show this ####<neu><score>0.0
And (uhh) Joel Schumacher, he he (stutter) was the one that directed this movie ####<neu><score>0.0
I mean, the the (stutter) people that were involved in this movie were the writer that wrote this was the same writer that wrote Seven ####<neu><score>0.0
So I didn't like eight millimeter ####<neg><score>-2.0
And and (stutter) they've done such great movies that that (stutter) were so successful in the past without the usage of of (stutter) this type of film and footage ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
So, eight millimeter ####<neu><score>0.0
I'm going to give it one star because I just don't like the the (stutter) basis behind how the movie was filmed and the way that the eight millimeter film was integrated into the footage ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
We’ve also seen some statements from the opposition side, Free Syrian Army, saying that they will abide by the UN Security Council and the UN Special Envoy’s call for a ceasefire tomorrow beginning for the Eid holiday and continuing into Sunday. ####<neu><score>0.0

Every cut considered will, of course, have a recipient on the other end whose livelihood is being threatened. ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
The creation of a 12 member committee to preside over $1.5 trillion in spending decisions, and the exclusion of the rest of Congress also means lobbying firms can focus their efforts on an anointed few, which is certainly more manageable for them than having to deal with the entire Congress. ####<neu><score>0.0
The founding fathers had strong feelings about taxation without representation and under no circumstances would they have felt excluding 98% of Congress from fiscal decisions was appropriate. ####<neg><score>-2.0
The probable outcome is that any cuts realized will be more a function of lobbying prowess than the merits or demerits of the actual programs on the chopping block. ####<neu><score>0.0
However, the process of getting there must also be constitutional. ####<neu><score>0.0
No benefit can come from such careless disregard of the Founders' design. ####<neg><score>-2.0
I suspect it will be highly vulnerable to corruption and special interests. ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632

Hello, this is Ron Paul with your weekly update for August 8th. ####<neu><score>0.0
This is because the commission presents a huge opportunity for lobbying firms to sneak their client's pet projects and issues into whatever legislation is created by the commission. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
The goal should be to eventually reduce government down to the size and scope of its constitutional limitations. ####<neu><score>0.0
One red flag I am constantly aware of in my position as a Congressman is that highly complex and convoluted legislation frequently has dangerous provisions hidden in the fine print. ####<neg><score>-2.0
The fact that automatic cuts to defense are named if the committee deadlocks simply signals to the military industrial complex to bring their A game to the lobbying effort. ####<pos><score>1.0
I don't usually have to read too much of a bill like that before encountering something unconstitutional, or simply unwise. ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632

As far as buying from wholesalers, there are a lot of different payment terms that you can also have. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
On the other hand, if I see it's not something that's selling well, I still have to pay them after thirty days, but I also know that I don't need to buy any more of that product, so I don't have to buy a large quantity to start out and take a risk on that. ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
This is really beneficial because it also shows me what products are selling, so for instance I want to put in a small order with a vendor, I can try a new product, if I see that customers are responding well to it, it's already paid for so by the time I have to pay the vendor off, and that allows me to buy more of it. ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408

Hi ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
(umm) Part of, I think, that the remarkable thing about the books is Douglas Adams wrote them sequentially, with no planning ahead of time as to what was gonna to happen ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
(umm) I'm not entirely convinced that the people who made this movie understood the books at all ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
(uhh) That's part of what makes them so amazing ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
And yet, they all come around into an incredibly tight plot and theme ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
They're certainly not going to now, I don't think ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
And this movie destroys all of that by sort of creating its own (umm) self-contained plot because I guess they weren't planning on making more movies ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) They just {sigh} it's hard to explain if you're not a Douglas Adams fan ####<neg><score>-1.0

(umm) It's not a great adaptation ####<neg><score>-1.0
Everything that he intended and all these sort of (umm) jokes that he meant to be funny in a particular way just aren't the same, and they've added a lot of their own jokes that are funny in a very different way, not not (stutter) what he would have wanted ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And I think the greatest example of that is the line at the very end, when Alan Rickman as the robot says, they're (stutter) heading to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which is the name of the second, the second (stutter) novel in the series, and is an actual setting in the novel ####<neu><score>0.0
Is it a good movie? I suppose it's kind of amusing in its own way, but it's not a good adaptation of the story ####<neg><score>-1.0
The restaurant was not, even if you casually read Douglas Adams, you know the restaurant is not at the physical end of the universe, it's at the temporal end of the universe ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And he says, not that anyone cares, or asked me, or whatever, but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
And that's sort of the main attraction of the restaurant ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
It's a place where you can go, utilizing time travel, you can go to this particular point in time, at just the point the universe ends, and watch it end ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
So, you know, whatever you want to sacrifice, I guess, but, (uhh) no, this movie doesn't capture the spirit of the story at all ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
This movie is terrible, and looks great ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736

Starring Bill Murray (uhh) and Andie MacDowell and (uhh) directed by Harold Ramis who started with Bill Murray and stripes (uhh) seven years before (umm) this is one of my favorite comedies of the last say twenty years it's a very simple premise done extremely well, and the simple premise is that a man gets stuck re-living the same day over and over again until he gets it right (uhh) in this case it's a weather man (uhh) played by Bill Murray who gets stuck in Groundhog Day in Puxatony, Philadelphia or excuse me Puxatony, Pennsylvania (uhh) until he gets the day right ####<pos><score>2.6666667461395264

(uhh) Chris Elliott does a really nice supporting job in here as the camera man (umm) I would really recommend getting this DVD (uhh) and if you rent it, or buy it, or whatever you do (uhh) You've got to listen to the Harold Ramis commentary track it's very informative, (uhh) very funny tell's you a lot about the movie (umm) little tidbits like they assumed while they're making the movie that (uhh) Bill Murray is is (stutter) stuck in this day for about ten years ####<pos><score>2.0
(umm) Somehow they found a way to make each new iteration of the day (uhh) different, fresh and it never gets boring in fact (uhh) as you go on you wait more and more to see (uhh) the familiar scenes play out in a different way and that's a lot of that credit goes to the script a lot of that credit goes to Bill Murray (uhh) and Andie Macdowell for keeping things fun ####<pos><score>3.0
So you get a sense of how long this is going on, even though you see maybe fifteen (uhh) versions of the day throughout the movie he's stuck in it much longer so you get a much greater sense of it ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

If you're a Tyler Perry fan, you may enjoy this movie, although I don't even like this one as much as his others and I didn't even like the others too much ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I am here to review a movie that is currently in theaters called Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns ####<neu><score>0.0
Hello, ExpoTV users ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

This movie, it has a good heart ####<pos><score>1.0
But she gets fired from her job and begins to get hopeless ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It's basically the story about a single mother raising her children, and she really wants to keep her kids off the street, obviously ####<neu><score>0.0
So she decides to take her family from Chicago down to Georgia for the funeral ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And then she finds out that a father, her father that she never even knew existed, had died ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Basically, it has some touching scenes ####<pos><score>1.0
And she meets a whole family she never knew existed ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) As a movie overall, I thought the acting was poor ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) But this movie kind of takes another direction and kind of opens your eyes to different issues in the world ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
I just think it's hard to make that work into a cohesive (umm) watchable (umm) story ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) The story could have been filmed a lot better I think, because it's very interesting ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) If it was purely (umm) (stutters) If it was purely historical, I think it would work ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) So the story was definitely very poor how they did it ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
But as a movie, (umm) it definitely falls short ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(uhh) Maybe to be shown in schools, something like that ####<neu><score>0.0
So I'm gonna say one out of five stars, as a movie ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

(umm) Instead of, you normally hear about (uhh) American slavery of the African Americans ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(umm) And the movie's really kind of just about white slavery or Asian slavery ####<neg><score>-1.0
It wasn't that good ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) So I think that's what they were really trying to push for was like the same audience, the same, oh this is going to be huge and epic ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) I would rent this one or maybe ask for it for like a holiday present just so I don't have to spend money on it ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(uhh) Three hundred was completely epic, this if if (stutter) you want a comparison just three hundred here, ten thousand BC here ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

It it (stutter) follows the story of this (stutter) mammoth hunter and it, trying to do better for his tribe, or trying to get his tribe a better life ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(umm) It it's (stutter) a good movie ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408

And like some of the camera work is just like oh this is horrible ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I mean that's cool but Jodie Foster doesn't do a great job, you know, so the only good thing about the acting is Abigail Breslin ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
I mean if you have to see it go see it because your little kid might want to see it or something, or your little brother or sister ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
I mean on a on a (stutter) scale of like stars I would give it definitely like two stars out of five ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I mean you could definitely take them to see something else ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632

(umm) This is a spoof movie of Spider Man but you can also say something, something (stutter) into account like X-man and (umm) some other movies ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
I'm only going to give it a one out of five stars because there's not a lot of redeeming quality to it ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) One of the best scenes is just kind of a touchy moment (umm) where, you know, a father and daughter have to say goodbye to one another ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
And for her to be alone on this island is ridiculous without a father or a babysitter, anything ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So that's the first (uhh) ridiculous part of the movie ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
The next ridiculous part is that a letter written by a little girl to a famous author would actually solicit a visit ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I mean, maybe the author would write back and say, you know, thanks for the letter, blah, blah, blah ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Now, this is not a very realistic story at all ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) First of all, who lives on a deserted island, a deserted volcanic island, with (uhh) just a father and a daughter? Nobody does that ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And especially when the father sails away to do science experiments and leaves Nim all by herself ####<neg><score>-1.0
I mean, she can't be more than, I don't know, twelve or thirteen ####<neu><score>0.0
And, you know, if that's the best scene in the movie, I think that says a lot ####<neg><score>-1.0
But, no, the author actually comes out to the island to be with this little girl ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(uhh) That's also ridiculous ####<neg><score>-2.0
I didn't know that this was supposed to be, you know, a joke and supposed to be all creative and imaginative ####<neg><score>-1.0

Today, I'm going to talk about the movie, Nim's Island ####<neu><score>0.0
He plays a little more of a bit part in this film, so if you're going to go rush out to see the movie for Gerard Butler, you're going to be disappointed ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) Many of you will recognize Gerard Butler from movies such as three hundred, where he played the main character in that film ####<neu><score>0.0
Nim is the main character of the movie ####<neu><score>0.0
He plays the role of a a (stutter) father ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) They're kind of secluded from everybody ####<neu><score>0.0
She is a little girl who lives on this island with her father, Gerard Butler ####<neu><score>0.0
I guess when I went to the film, I didn't know what to expect ####<neu><score>0.0
And definitely if you're an adult, don't go in prepared to believe everything ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And to counter this, Nim has a lot of fanciful creatures that she's created ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) The father is a scientist who does a lot of research and needs a lot of time for his experiments, so he doesn't have a lot of time for his daughter, Nim ####<neu><score>0.0
She loves to read books ####<neu><score>0.0
She has a very active imagination in this one ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

That's her favorite hobby ####<neu><score>0.0
A storm comes out ####<neu><score>0.0
And what happens is, Nim's father goes out to sea to do a experiment ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Nim writes her favorite author for some help, saying that her father's lost, what does she do, how does she get through life, I mean, what's her next step And Jodie Foster's character comes out to the island to hang out with Nim and try to help her cope and do things like that ####<neu><score>0.0
He gets lost out at sea ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It's very fanciful (umm), lots of crazy stuff going on in the way of imagination ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
(umm) So it's not very believable ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) But it's just kind of a fun movie for the younger generation ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
I would say the storm scene might be a little frightening for some younger kids ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It can be a little scary ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
There's a little bit of action ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
And if you have a daughter or a son who is probably under the age of ten, I think they'd love it because there's some imaginary creatures ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
(uhh) It's definitely a little kid's movie ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
There wasn't anything new in terms of comedy ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
No real humor that really got me rolling or anything like that ####<neg><score>-2.0
No special effects ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Soundtrack is debatable ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
For instance, there's a movie called Road Trip, a movie called Eurotrip ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And while those were all teenagers and, and (stutter) more a little about drugs and getting drunk and sex, it's still the kind of same humor, where people drive around and they say funny things and there's a parent you try to avoid because they will get you in trouble ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
And that just felt like the same thing for this movie ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Definitely not one of my favorites ####<neg><score>-2.0
(umm) There was one good song, many okay songs, and a couple songs I just wondered why they were even on the soundtrack, what a waste of my life ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) I'm only going to give this movie a two out of five stars for all of those reasons ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
This is Aub eighty four ####<neu><score>0.0
Hey, ExpoTV ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) Before I go into character detail, I'll give you a little heads up about what the movie is about ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Today I'm going to talk about the movie College Road Trip, starring Martin Lawrence and Raven Symone ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
And he's very worried about the kind of trouble that she's going to get into when she's away at college (umm) you know, drugs, sex, parties, things like that ####<neu><score>0.0
Martin Lawrence plays a police officer who decides to go on a road trip with his daughter, playing by Raven Symone, to check out colleges ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) Many of you will recognize Raven Symone ####<neu><score>0.0
So basically the movie revolves around how he tries to keep her away from these kinds of things while they're on the road trip, and he definitely is trying to pick out a college that is clean and well-run and not going to lead her astray ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) She has a couple of movies out ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
She was a child actor on a lot of TV shows ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) Obviously, she's of college age for this movie, and I think she does a much better job of acting now than she did when she was a kid, (uhh) maybe understandable, a little more training, a little more experience could do a lot ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
And I was actually surprised to see how much she's grown up ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
(umm) I would say that if you've seen a Martin Lawrence comedy, you've seen this movie ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(uhh) Martin Lawrence is in his typical role, kind of a wise-cracking humor (umm) lots of situational gags, some physical comedy ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(uhh) One of the best parts of the movie is a scene where (umm) Martin Lawrence's character finds these coffee beans and he thinks they're drugs ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
It's very similar ####<neu><score>0.0
So that was kind of a situational, physical, ha, ha, ha bit ####<neu><score>0.0
And so he feeds them to this pig and the pig goes crazy on caffeine ####<neu><score>0.0
I guess there's just not much that hasn't been done for kind of the college road trip type deal ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
And that was one of the funnier scenes of the movie, unfortunately ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Don't rush out to see it in the theaters ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
If you do have to see it, I would say rent it ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And (uhh) this is by far my favorite one ####<pos><score>2.3333332538604736
I think this was the last one that (uhh) that me and my friends in (uhh) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, watched before I moved to Chicago ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
And (uhh) I have fond memories of watching this tremendous piece of crap with (uhh) my friends before moving ####<neg><score>-2.0
I, I (stutter) honestly think that they just used a body double for him so that he did not have to be in the same room with anyone else ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408

This is Freejack ####<neu><score>0.0
He (uhh) lifted (uhh) large elements of the plot ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(umm) I first heard of this movie (uhh) when a friend of mine in grade school decided to (uhh) rip off its storyline for a (uhh) short story that he had written (uhh) in grade school ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
And (uhh) (uhh) this movie storyline and his storyline are as follows: (uhh) Emilio Estevez plays a race car driver who (umm) just as he is about to die in a (uhh) horrible race car driving accident, he, his (stutter) body is snatched into the future, (uhh) thanks to (uhh) a billionaire Anthony Hopkins ####<neu><score>0.0
And (uhh) as he was explaining this in front of the class, I thought to myself, huh, that sounds an awful lot like Freejack ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(umm) Also in this movie is Rene Russo, who was in Lethal Weapons three and four, and the Thomas Crown Affair ####<neu><score>0.0
And (umm) the reason Anthony Hopkins' character does that is so he can take his (uhh) mind and implant it into the body of Emilio Estevez's character, thus giving him eternal life or some nonsense ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And his performance is terrible in this movie ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736

He communicates with Rene Russo's character (uhh) via a (uhh) telecommunications device ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) I think for like the first half of the movie, at the very least, he's not even in the same room with any of the other main characters ####<neg><score>-1.0
And the backdrop is just some mad painting and it looks terrible ####<neg><score>-2.0
And he's (uhh) either in, like, China or (uhh) France or something ####<neg><score>-1.0
I honestly think that in, in (stutter) like the final third of the movie, or whatever, in the latter half of the movie, I actually think it's more like the final third or the final quarter, when he actually is in the same room with Emilio Estevez and Rene Russo ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And (umm) he really, really, sincerely, honestly phoned in his performance ####<neg><score>-2.0
All right? All right, now, all right, the acting was okay, but the writing wasn't good, and there's nothing new about the screen shots, the cinematography ####<neg><score>-2.0

Hello everyone ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(uhh) It stars Eric Bana as a (uhh) the the (stutter) leader of a group of (uhh) Israelis who are given the task of killing the eleven Palestinians who (uhh) were responsible for the nineteen-seventy-two (uhh) Munich massacre of (uhh) eleven Israeli athletes ####<neu><score>0.0

It (uhh) really didn't (uhh) involve me at any kind of, you know, serious emotional level ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
It was based on the (uhh) book Vengeance by George Jonas and (uhh) I really didn't like this movie that much ####<neg><score>-2.0
(umm) That that (stutter) revelation really didn't blow me away that they were feeling that way and (umm) and I I (stutter) have a personal rule that if (uhh), you know, you don't really know the names of characters you can't really get that involved with them, and in all honesty the only two people whose names I remember from this movie are Avner who was (uhh) Eric Bana's character and Carl who was played (uhh) (umm) by (uhh) Ciaran Hinds (uhh) in this movie and (umm) I really didn't (uhh) I I (stutter) like I I (stutter) really didn't have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters in this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
(umm) It's supposed to be about the (uhh) the toll that murder takes on, you know, normal people and (uhh) again, I I (stutter) like I just it didn't really surprise me that these people were experiencing regret that they were killing, you know, people even though those people themselves (uhh) may have deserved it ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(uhh) Geoffrey Rush is in it and (uhh) he was alright and (umm) Daniel Craig who was James Bond is also in the movie but (uhh) there there (stutter) were some genuine moments of like tension and excitement and (uhh) but in all honesty it really didn't add up to much for me ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) I I (stutter) was really unaffected by it ####<neg><score>-1.0
(uhh) They're homosexual in real life and so that aids them in playing gay men, but I don't think they embody their characters well enough ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
They don't make you feel like they're actually who they say they are ####<neg><score>-1.0
Why aren't they going to, you know, work hard for me?" And I think you'll get that a lot in this movie ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) There is a little bit of race issue in this, too, because one of the guys is white and one of the guys is a minority ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
So it's interesting to see not only are they gay and struggling to deal with that, with each other, they're also (uhh), you know, the race issue comes into play a couple of times, as well ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
So there's kind of a lot of dynamics going on here ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) One one (stutter) of the main things I didn't like about the movie is that the two main actors aren't very good ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
I don't think they get into their roles enough ####<neg><score>-1.0
There is a lot of profanity in this movie, (umm) so if you're worried about that I wouldn't see it ####<neg><score>-1.0
(uhh) Not a lot of overtly sexual content ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
(umm) Obviously, you're going to see a bunch of good looking guys in in various states of undress, but not any, you know, graphic sexual depictions, or anything like that ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) But if you don't mind that kind of thing, and you're into a little light discussion about how, you know, a gay couple tries to make things work, you might be mildly entertained ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
There's nothing that you're going to miss ####<neg><score>-1.0
(uhh) And you're gonna save a few bucks, as well ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Don't worry about seeing this in theater ####<neg><score>-1.0
Rent this one ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
I would have liked to see it with a more well known lead actor, (umm) who really wanted to get into the role ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
I'm only going to give this a one of five star ####<neg><score>-2.0
And the two main actors (uhh) actually were writers of this movie as well, so it makes me think, that it's not that they weren't into the movie, it's just kinda how they act ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Which is kinda disappointing ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(uhh) This is a more independent film, so many of you won't be able to find it at your major theaters ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408

It it's (stutter) a gay movie ####<neu><score>0.0
If you have an independent or unaffiliated theater near you, this is where you're going to find this movie ####<neu><score>0.0
It starts out where one of the guys is kinda macho man ####<neu><score>0.0
It follows the story of a two gay gentlemen who end up (uhh) hooking up and trying to make a relationship work ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
He sleeps around a lot ####<neu><score>0.0
He's (uhh) he's (stutter) all about the guys ####<neu><score>0.0
He's afraid of commitment ####<neg><score>-1.0
He's never been tied down ####<neu><score>0.0
I don't know th if this is, you know, how they are in all their movies, or if they just weren't into this movie ####<neg><score>-1.0
(uhh) I haven't seen any other movies with either of them in it, so I don't know what they're normally like ####<neu><score>0.0
And he's got a lot of (uhh), you know, friends with him who kinda do much of the same ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
He's just out to have a good time ####<neu><score>0.0
He's, you know, all about lovey-dovey, commitment, relationship and the two end up falling in love together ####<neu><score>0.0
However, one time he goes into a bar and he meets this guy, and his name is Stephen, who is exact opposite ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
It deals with a lot of homosexual issues (umm) in terms of acceptance and they try to deal with love in their own way and how the mainstream doesn't really accept that a lot of times ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) The story is mostly about how they try to deal with being in a monogamous relationship (uhh) when the one guy kinda isn't very used to that ####<neu><score>0.0
It it (stutter) pretends as though it's just a normal couple who are doing a normal thing and never mind that they're homosexual, they're just out trying to (umm), you know, have a loving relationship and go on ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(umm) While while (stutter) the homosexual aspect is kind of brought up in this movie, and it it (stutter) is influenced (umm) by the mainstream, most of the movie focuses just on the two guys' relationship and how they try to make it work ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
A supporting cast, I would say is equal to that or even worse ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
I think that's kind of refreshing actually because (uhh) I found (uhh) a lot of the homosexual movies focus too much on, you know, the idea that they're being persecuted or that it's so hard to be gay in today's society or, you know, they're always looked down upon and they struggle through life ####<pos><score>1.0
You're left like, "Well I paid good money for this ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(umm) If you've been left feeling empty by other movies before, you know what that feels like when a character doesn't sell it right you kinda, you know, you're left hallow ####<neg><score>-1.0
But you will notice the main actors just kinda not flowing very well together ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(uhh) Maybe if you haven't seen as many movies, you won't notice some of the supporting actors being bored ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And I, if you've seen a lot of movies, you kinda know what that looks like and you can kinda pick up on that ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(uhh) Some scenes, I've see, I mean guys looking off just kinda bored and like they're not even wanting to be part of this movie ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And this movie, while it kind of hints at that a little bit, it's definitely not its main focus and it it's (stutter) barely touched upon, actually ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) If you don't like gay movies, if you don't like the homosexual issue, obviously, this isn't gonna be a movie for you ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(uhh) I don't know where he got the idea for this, but it really is absolutely terrible ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
(uhh) So I really would not bother with with (stutter) You Don't Mess With the Zohan at all, like, not even on DVD, absolutely nothing ####<neg><score>-2.0
But, like but like (stutter) the story and the whole plot, it was just absolutely terrible ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264

Another thing I noticed (uhh) was the animation part, it seems that they have just focused on the bodies of these two you know the Hulk and the evil guy ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

And I think that's the way it's going to be ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) The idea, as far-fetched as it is in the movie, is probably the best part of the movie ####<pos><score>1.0
It wasn't, like, the worst movie ever made, like some people are saying, but it was pretty awful ####<neg><score>-2.0
But everything about the movie, the dialog, the acting, the casting (umm), the pace, the tone, the plot, where it goes, the scary moments, the gore, all that that I just named is awful ####<neg><score>-3.0
The idea he came up with for the movie, that was probably the best part ####<pos><score>1.0

And I wish I could I could (stutter) talk longer ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Now, I have to make this review kind of short ####<neu><score>0.0
(stutter) Just take more time on your movies ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
You seriously, this could have been, had so much more potential and it went nowhere and you didn't care ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Seriously ####<neg><score>-2.0
Come out with a movie every three years, maybe every four years even ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) The storyline and the way it was written, like I said, the idea was good, but M ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Night Shyamalan, take a break ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Just take a year off and get your head together, because that, that (stutter) movie, it was just absolutely terrible ####<neg><score>-3.0
Your dialog, delivery, and everything about what you did, everything, everything about what you did was absolutely terrible ####<neg><score>-3.0

And I said to myself, if this one, The Happening, is not as good as his first three, I am going to say I'm not going to go see his movies anymore ####<neg><score>-3.0
Okay? You do not, Mark Wahlberg, he's not a science teacher ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
Okay? Because he's a science teacher ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
He should not play this character at all ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And then, he doesn't play this character at all ####<neg><score>-1.0
I'm not saying Mark Wahlberg is not a good actor, because he is, but, first of all, not in this movie ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
And the casting ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
All those reasons, plus a million more (umm) that makes this movie so bad ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) I really, you know, like I said, I really wish I could go on forever about this movie, but, in a nutshell, I do not recommend this movie ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
So I do not recommend seeing this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
And it doesn't matter that it's a movie, we're not going to believe that ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Because the movie (umm) yeah, the most important thing I wanna share about this is that the starting of the movie, it just happened like real fun that something is happening, something is happening it's not like you set a bag down and then start on the storyline ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
So and in the first scene they have shown that something is happening to the city ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
And so that scene is continued to the end of the movie ####<neu><score>0.0
So as I say I'm gonna give this movie two out of five ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(umm) So this movie (umm) like, I do not want to disclose the suspense but there is a bit of suspense in this movie (umm) that this, only this guy was saved just from the whole northeast coast just so the guy was like ####<neu><score>0.0
and then after sometime like xxx show up that this guy's letting his (umm) regular life and then the same thing happens some other place ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) That's that's (stutter) the point where the movie ends ####<neu><score>0.0
So in this movie (umm) I would just say that (umm) probably gonna give this movie like a two out of five ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(umm) Today I'll be reviewing the movie The Happening ####<neu><score>0.0
Hi guys ####<neu><score>0.0
Night Shyamalan and written by M ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) This movie just released this week and it's been directed by M ####<neu><score>0.0
And so most of you know M ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Night Shyamalan ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) But he also made some movies like the Lady In Water ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Night Shyamalan he's famous for some movie like (umm) the one of the great escape, (umm) Sixth Sense ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) So xxx I just, I went to the theater to watch this movie and let me firstly tell you it's not that good movie ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
So I, so in my mind it cause kind of mixed feeling like whether it's gonna be like (umm) The Sign or it's gonna be like The Happening ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Because (umm) in all the movie you are just like (umm) they they're (stutter) gonna open suspense, they're gonna open the suspense now, now, now but ####<neu><score>0.0
If I were rate Sixth Sense as a ten out of ten I would give this movie just like two out of ten ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So in this movie (umm) the main leading character a science teacher played by Eric Moore (umm) the character Erik Moore is being playing by Mark Wahlberg ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) To a standard movie for still like a misleading (umm) a storyline ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(umm) In this movie he is shown as a science teacher and to his point of the (stutter) amusement that (umm) he found that something strange is happening all around the northeast (umm) coast of the country ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And he is the main leading character ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) So in the movie you see like (umm) something return two or three and depressing xxx say totally sharp so if you are taking your children be careful because there are gonna be some scenes which could be like, so many people dead lying on the street or hanging on the tree ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(umm) So they they (stutter) cannot figure out what's actually happening ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
So warning for that ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
So that's a little scary and you don't you don't (stutter) want your children to look at those (umm) scenes ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Don't even waste renting it on DVD ####<neg><score>-3.0
For twenty-four hours and that's it ####<neg><score>-1.0
If it comes on cable, see it then ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Night Shyamalan again ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) And Zoey I've got hope for you, but don't trust M ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
They're just running away from wind because it's carrying, well there's actually no real (stutter) explanation really but they think the trees are trying to poison them because it makes the part of their brain, some chemical part in their brain shut off (umm) so they all kill themselves ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
So I think what M ####<neu><score>0.0
Night Shyamalan really wanted to do was make a movie where he could just have people kill themselves in the most creative ways possible, because that's all this was ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And it wasn't even that gory, like ####<neg><score>-2.0
It could have been so much more, it really could have been but Mark Wahlberg just killed it, he killed it ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
It's people running away from wind ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Yup ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Night Shyamalan because I don't know ####<neg><score>-1.0
He must have a stroke or something between films because this is just so bad I don't know why he thought this would be a good idea ####<neg><score>-3.0
I give it one star because it's the lowest I can go but if I could go lower I would ####<neg><score>-3.0
The Happening, don't see it, it will waste your time and it will make you so sad for everyone involved, especially M ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
That's all I can say, don't do not (stutter) see this movie ####<neg><score>-3.0
There's nothing more I can say ####<neg><score>-1.0
It, he was so unreal in this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
I mean even in one part an old lady's like, you're gonna kill me in my sleep and he's like, what, no ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
I was so psyched about it because I figured it was the comeback, it's the first R-rated movie, it's gonna be grotesque, it's gonna be twisted, it's gonna be awesome ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
No, do not waste your money on this film ####<neg><score>-3.0
(umm) This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that's not even a lie ####<neg><score>-2.0
Hey Expo TV, today I'm reviewing The Happening ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

I've I've (stutter) seen a lot of really bad movies, I walked out of a couple movies ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) Mark Wahlberg was terrible, he will never get a job after this hopefully, because he was so bad in this movie ####<neg><score>-3.0
Night Shyamalan to pull something at the very end ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Night Shyamalan wanted this to be campy and like a two hour long Twilight Zone and with even worse actors than they had back in the day ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
And M ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) I know people are rooting for M ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(umm) They were actually really good in Twilight Zone, this is this is (stutter) that was a insult to the Twilight Zone this is a terrible movie ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
But you know what, that was okay ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
I was looking forward to this film all summer ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
He can get back into that, I don't know what's wrong with him why is he doing this, I'm really pissed off at this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
He's just on, (stutter) he hit his peak at twenty-three years old, like this kid he he (stutter) doesn't know what he's doing any more ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Night Shyamalan I know that you know, he hasn't made a movie since Lady In the Water, god forbid that movie too ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(uhh) Unbreakable was pretty good ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
The Sixth Sense was a beautiful movie, it was a beautiful film I love that film ####<pos><score>2.3333332538604736
(uhh) And then there came The Village which was not great but it was still okay ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(uhh) Signs, awesome ####<pos><score>1.0
Night Shyamalan for that, we were like, oh it's the twist and then it came and you're like (uhh) ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
There was the twist there we counted on M ####<neu><score>0.0
Mainly Lady In the Water which was just an atrocity, and The Happening was even worse ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
But even then don't go see it, don't even see it as a satire, it's not worth it ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
But like I said maybe he meant it to be really campy and really silly and if he did, good job ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Like come on, have some emotion, like, don't sound like me {laughter} sound like a man who's like (uhh) and Zoey Deschanel I like her too but she just did a very poor job in this movie ####<neg><score>-3.0
Night Shyamalan get your act together and Mark Wahlberg, (uhh) go back to Marky Mark that's what you gotta do but do not go back on film ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
Night Shyamalan has got to get back on track, we need another Signs, we need another Sixth Sense, we need another Unbreakable ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

(uhh) It was I guess it was like definitely along the lines of Signs and like Sixth Sense, of those movies ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
But you but you (stutter) guys might like it ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
It was just like, a little bit more like violent and I guess that's why it they rated it R ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
But it wasn't as good ####<neg><score>-1.0
It's not good ####<neg><score>-2.0

(uhh) It's like a, it's starring Mark Wahlberg ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
And (uhh) the movie is about how there's this like, (stutter) parent, this like, random thing and just, (stutter) like threating off like like like (stutter) it, like basically every person ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
And it's from like the producer of (uhh) or, of like (uhh) Signs and this, (stutter) Sixth Sense ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(uhh) But it was interesting but it was like kind of like, this can't be happening like, what like, what's going on why are all these people just going crazy ####<neg><score>-1.0
And it's just making them do crazy stuff and like everyone's just like dying and stuff it's really, really weird ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So like this movie isn't supposed to be like a romantic comedy or something ####<neg><score>-1.0
It's like Mike Myers does stuff like Wayne's World and like Austin Powers and stuff ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
I really don't like Mike Myers that much ####<neg><score>-2.0
It's like just like a, really dull comedy I thought ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And this movie it (stutter) should, like the trailer should not be getting as many like slots, like during commercials that it's it's (stutter) like, getting cause it's really not good ####<neg><score>-2.0
I think he's definitely overrated ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
It's not as good as like, it's not as good as Austin Powers or anything ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(uhh) But see it I guess, if you like Mike Myers ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
(uhh) A couple cameo like appearances from from (stutter) players on the Toronto Maple Leafs and from the Los Angeles Kings so check it out if you want to ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
But (uhh) It's called The Love Guru ####<neu><score>0.0
I have a (stutters) movie review for a Mike Meyers new movie called The Love Guru ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
What's up Expo TV ####<pos><score>1.0
Like there's been a lot of trailers for it ####<neu><score>0.0
Came out last week ####<neg><score>-1.0
It's rated PG-thirteen for crude and sexual content, language, some violence and drug references ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(uhh) it's ninety minutes long ####<neu><score>0.0
Like who are basically like, like, like, (stutter) they know everything about dating and love and stuff and (uhh) like he gets sent on this mission to like, I guess help out a marriage between between (stutter) Toronto Maple Leafs player and like his wife because his wife has been seeing a guy from from the Los Angeles Kings ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(uhh) The movie's about how he was adopted by a by gurus ####<neu><score>0.0
But like it really doesn't work cause it's supposed to be really funny ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
So (uhh) It's So it's like so it's like (stutter) how like he's like trying to help out this marriage ####<neu><score>0.0
So a full length movie is really hard to pull off with this premise, you know? The premise itself might have been good, might have been workable, but this is definitely not a workable version of it ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
So I'm going to give The Love Guru a one out of five ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
(umm) Rent it maybe? See it at a super budget price maybe? But (uhh) it's questionable whether or not you should even do that ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So Love Guru one out of five for being a very crude, very juvenile adaptation of a not so great premise ####<neg><score>-2.0
As formality here's my movie ticket, and there we go ####<neu><score>0.0
Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie The Love Guru starring Mike Myers ####<neu><score>0.0
I mean (uhh) Austin Powers was pretty hilarious, almost all of them were ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
So, what'd I think about this movie? Mike Myers is usually pretty funny ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Love Guru not so much ####<neg><score>-1.0
(uhh) Wayne's World was funny ####<pos><score>2.3333332538604736
It's just primarily that most of the movie is really crude and, you know, for a guy that usually does humor that's a little better than this, I mean it can be slapstick and silly, but not usually quite this level of just crude stupidness ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
I mean it's not that Love Guru doesn't have at least a few funny jokes ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
You know I always thought that Austin Powers was pretty juvenile, but in reality it was actually a fairly good level of intellect ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Makes you wonder what he's thinking when he decided to make this movie ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
It could have been a lot stupider" ####<neg><score>-1.0
Sort of a James Bondy joke, you know? And you really only realize this after watching this movie when you go "Oh ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632

You know, it's even the line that he uses in the preview ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
In reality I really feel this movie is like, yeah, (umm) it's about on par with some of the stupid Saturday Night Live sketches ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
He's kind of a dork and the stuff he says is just sort of ridiculous most of the time, and the advice he gives is horrible and sorta questions whether or not it's any good at all ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

(uhh) It utilizes pretty much the same cast from beginning to end and it's about (umm) (uhh) some sort of a strange signal that is (uhh) broadcast from an (uhh) unspecified source (uhh) over television waves and (uhh) radio waves and cellular phones, and regular phone lines ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
It felt like something along the lines of twenty-eight days later ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And the first third of the movie I really enjoyed, I thought it was a really solid setup (umm) for a pretty good horror movie ####<pos><score>2.0
And in the middle of the movie (umm) tried really, really hard (uhh) to be funny and failed spectacularly ####<neg><score>-2.0
And it just, it felt really solid and like it was going to be a good movie ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
So unbelievable ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Dude is so bad, it's just like embarrassing, some of the acting he does ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And (uhh) yeah, it just wasn't good ####<neg><score>-2.0
And he, M ####<neu><score>0.0
But no, the the (stutter) three or four times you see it happening in the previews are the only times it happens in the movie ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
So basically you could save yourself the time, go on Youtube and watch the preview of the movie, and you would get all the most intense parts of the movie in that preview ####<neg><score>-2.0
(uhh) The rest of the movie (stutter) stunk ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(uhh) Mark Wahlberg, terrible, terrible actor ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Night Shamalyan is always in his own movies ####<neu><score>0.0
Which, sometimes it's not bad ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
(umm) And I was hoping I would forget about it, that's why I haven't done a review on it yet ####<neg><score>-2.0
Hey what's up Expo TV? (umm) Stephen Boyd here (uhh) here to talk about a movie I saw about a week ago ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
It was a movie called The Happening, and it was bad, it was really really bad ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
(umm) It was a depressing experience (uhh) to say the least ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
Night Shamylan I think ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(umm) Here's the thing, it was written and directed by, I can never say this guy's name right,M ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Night Shmamalan or something like that ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
M ####<neu><score>0.0
It's written and directed by him ####<neu><score>0.0
But anyways ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Really disappointed, don't waste your time ####<neg><score>-3.0
I was like oh, I like your other movies, I'll see this one ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
He did The Sixth Sense ####<neu><score>0.0
You all know him ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) Those movies ####<neu><score>0.0
He did Signs ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) Everyones making a big deal because it was his first R rated movie ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And I really love those movies and I, I (stutter) though, you know his other movies weren't as bad as people made them seem, you know they weren't like fantastic, but this movie is just terrible ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Like I was hopping there'd be more violence because if you go to a rated R movie about like ####<neg><score>-1.0
I was like Oh okay well, you know there's a reason it's probably rated R and it just kinda sucked ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
Basically it's like a family on the run from like this, this (stutter) natural crisis that's taking people over and like making them kill themselves in really horrific way, and in the previews you see like three or four people killing themselves and you're like oh my gosh that's really intense, this is gonna be a really intense movie ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Oh yeah I guess I should tell you a little bit about the plot ####<neu><score>0.0
I don't know, he's not a very good actor either ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
In this one it's just like stupid ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
It really let me down and also because I gave him a chance ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
So one out of five stars for this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
You could like, go watch (umm) all the videos that Expo TV rejected for two hours, or an hour and a half, and that would be a better (uhh) better way to spend your time than to see this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
There's so many better things you could do with your time ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was so bad ####<neg><score>-3.0
But (umm) don't even rent this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So we’re the Ohio state university, so we definitely have a passionate feel for all our big ten colleagues out there. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
That’s only going to be a major positive for you as you’re coming through the process. ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
It's supposed to be a comedy but you'll go in there and you'll be waiting to laugh but you never will, and then it'll be time to go ####<neg><score>-2.0
The best thing about the movie was that it's only eighty-seven minutes long so you don't have to endure too much ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I'd say (stutter) there's much more movies out there that are (uhh) so much more better than this ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So I wouldn't recommend this movie at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
If you want to waste your time go see one called The Love Guru ####<neg><score>-1.0
I just returned from the movies ####<neu><score>0.0
Guru, okay? Has Ben Kingsley in it ####<neu><score>0.0
That's G U R U ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Simson ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It's got Mike Myers, he's the, the (stutter) main character ####<neu><score>0.0
It's got a few others in there (uhh) that you will probably have heard about and usually when a movie has a lot of different people in it that you know about it's usually not gonna be very good and this one wasn't ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Simpson ####<neu><score>0.0
He (stutter) co-wrote this movie from what I understand and it's just, it's just absolutely horrid ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
Mike Myers is absolutely awful ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
(umm) Hellboy Two, I wasn't all that excited to go see this but you know, people are going to see it so I was like, whatever I'll go and it definitely didn't live up to even my low expectations ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Hey expotv, today I'm gonna review the movie that's currently in theaters (umm) and that movie would be Hellboy Two ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) By the way the subtitle to this movie is Hellboy Two and the Golden Army ####<neu><score>0.0
I thought it was worse than what I thought it would be ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
(umm) I don't know, something about the whole Hellboy theme I don't really like, personally ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
Pretty much it's more just rampaging through Hellboy beating people down and saying clever little phrases ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
So you know if you're a, if you're (stutter) a Hellboy fan you'll probably like it actually, but if you're just a general viewer I highly doubt you'll enjoy it, just because you don't really have any connection to it and it's just not good ####<neg><score>-1.0
You know, it's another one of these blockbusters from a comic book ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
If you don't have a connection it probably won't be good cause it's it's (stutter) just annoying ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
(uhh) I'd say it was the average anime ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
I, I (stutter) didn't see it so much ####<neg><score>-2.0
It's a anime ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
This is Blood: The Last Vampire ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
A lot of people highly recommend this ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
It's considered like a masterpiece ####<pos><score>1.0
They even made a series after it, based off of the movie ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
I watched it, I didn't think it was that great ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
It didn't actually start taking root til the very end of the like the last thirty minutes of the movie and by that time it was already over ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
The story, by the time it got started, it was already over ####<neg><score>-1.0
But a lot of people praised it for its graphics at the time ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
The animation, the graphics of it, it was it looked really good in some parts, and it some parts it looked horrible ####<neg><score>-1.0
It was kind of depressing in parts and it just didn't rebound to give the highs to the positive notes of the movie like it should have ####<neg><score>-2.0
So even though it, the music dragged you down with a sad part of the movie, it did not bring you back up when it turned around and got happy ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And I don't want to ruin anything, give away any plot spoilers or anything like that, (uhh) but things, you know, get better ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
When, when (stutter) he has an awakening, you can kind of expect that things are going to look up from there ####<neu><score>0.0
So I was let down, quite honestly ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
(umm) I had heard little about the film before I saw it, but what I had heard was positive and, and, (stutter) your know, uplifting and thinking that it was going to be a good movie ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(umm) But, like I said, everything put together here wasn't ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
The soundtrack was downer ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
One thing to make the movie better, I think, I think (stutter) when it goes into the actual writing and directing, I don't think the writer or director brought out what they could have in these actors and actresses ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Now, the writer just writes it and kind of leaves it at that, but a lot of them tweak it (uhh) based on what the (umm) actors' and actresses' input is ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Aubs eighty four here today to talk to you about the movie the Ripple Effect, which is currently in theaters ####<neu><score>0.0
Hey, ExpoTV ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) Forest Whitaker and Minnie Driver are the two that I recognized and that I have seen in other films ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) This movie is kind of low budget and doesn't feature a lot of well-known actors or actresses ####<neg><score>-1.0
Everything is kind of going downhill ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) The basic storyline of this movie is that there is a Hollywood (uhh) director and his life has kind of fallen apart, his marriage, his finances, his relationships ####<neu><score>0.0
So just like if you throw a rock in a, in a (stutter) pool of water, (umm) the ripples kind of go out and they alter and affect all the water around them ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And the idea is that these changes kind of ripple out and affect all aspects of his life and lead to new things ####<neu><score>0.0
(umm) Fortunately, though, this guy does not let that ruin him or bring him down ####<pos><score>1.0
In the same same (stutter) (uhh) stance, when his personal life kind of falls apart, it ripples out and affects this guy's professional life as well ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Now, I don't know if this movie is (uhh) very well done, quite honestly ####<neg><score>-1.0
It actually leads to a sort of awakening or revival, and he sets out to change a few things and to make his life better and to try to take, take (stutter) things into his own hands and do what he can to right all the situations ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
And the main actor in this one also, even though I've never seen him before, I have to believe that he's had better performances like this ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) It kind of seems like Minnie Driver and Forest Whitaker have had much better performances ####<neg><score>-2.0
I just don't picture this guy as as (stutter), I don't (stutter) picture the actor actually being this guy, going through this really hard time and, and (stutter) struggling through his life, as he deals with his marriage and everything else ####<neg><score>-1.0
He doesn't seem to embody the character very well ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) A poor job in that respect ####<neg><score>-2.0
He doesn't sell it very well, in other words ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) As I mentioned, the supporting actors and actresses kind of don't live up to the billing, they don't live up to (umm) what they could have done and what they have done in some of their other roles ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And I think that, like the movie says, ripples out and affects the rest of the cast as well ####<neu><score>0.0
But I just don't see that being done ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
So, for instance, if they think this scene might work a little bit better this way, or if the director suggest that (umm) this scene might be better dialogued this way, you know, the writer writes that in and makes changes ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) Save your money ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Not a whole lot of redeeming quality about this movie ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
I'm only going to give it a one out of five stars ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
Maybe he was just given bad advice and made changes for the worse, or maybe, like I think, the actors, actresses, and director just weren't in this one wholeheartedly ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
The soundtrack is nonexistent, for the most part ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
Not that it could have added much to a movie like this, but still, at least maybe some good music would have redeemed it in a small way ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
But not even that ####<neu><score>0.0
So it's all downhill ####<neg><score>-2.0
Gets up the next morning and it goes, anyway, you get the idea ####<neu><score>0.0
It keeps going round and round and round ####<neg><score>-1.0
Same thing over and over and over again ####<neg><score>-1.0
Not worth seeing, not worth renting, not worth wasting your life over, quite frankly ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
(umm) Nobody can really act in this one ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
It all keeps, seems very staged, very set up, nobody is acting natural, nobody is getting into their roles, and nobody is meshing with one another ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
(umm) This is a very low-quality film, very low budget, nobody (uhh) of any kind of (umm) ability actually in acting is in this film (umm) no well-known actors, no well-known actresses, nobody directing or even writing it that you probably would have ever heard of ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
ExpoTV, this is Aubs eighty four and I'm going to talk to you today about the movie The Doorman, which is currently in theaters ####<neu><score>0.0
And he's very popular, very well known ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
It follows the story of a doorman in New York City, or basically a bouncer at one of the clubs ####<neu><score>0.0
And it's all about him and his life and he's so cool ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(uhh) He kind of goes on a big power trip about how he can get people into this club and how he knows all these people and blah, blah, blah ####<neg><score>-1.0
(uhh) The people he knew and were so friendly with, I mean, they don't talk to him anymore since the, he can't get them into any clubs ####<neu><score>0.0
(uhh) But eventually, he loses his job and he comes crashing down to earth (uhh) when he loses his job because he realizes he pretty much has nothing to go on ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And they weren't really friends at all ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
They were basically using him for (uhh) his position at the door ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Now, that that (stutter) may sound like it has some potential and it may be going somewhere and it could be, you know, some big story about self-revelation or interesting of the fact that he knows all these people and it could be synopses of people's lives that come to the club and the information he can get from them, and, you know, just kind of cool, it could be kind of like a back, (uhh) behind-the-scenes type of cool thing about these popular people ####<neu><score>0.0
And he kind of tries to come to terms with this, has to get a grip on things and realize what's actually going on in his life and what he has going for him ####<neu><score>0.0
It's actually quite terrible ####<neg><score>-2.0
(umm) However, it's nothing like that ####<neg><score>-1.0
The writing (umm) was pathetic, (uhh) quite frankly ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
It is basically a big ego trip by this doorman guy (umm) and how he wallows in self-pity and self-realization when it turns out that he actually has nothing ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
It's basically a big circle ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
The story goes nowhere ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Do not waste your time on this one ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
(uhh) One out of five stars is what I have to give it because I can't give a zero out of five stars ####<neg><score>-3.0
I would say that this movie should have gone straight to DVD or straight to the garbage, quite frankly ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
It's almost as if they're all competing with each other to get a space and to try to get themselves known so they can go to Hollywood and make a real good film ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Gets up the next morning and it goes around in a circle again ####<neu><score>0.0
He wakes up one day, feels sorry for himself, tries to get over it, can't, goes out, gets shunned by these people he's tied to, comes back, and crashes, gets drunk and is worthless ####<neu><score>0.0
It had so much potential and it could have been a whole lot better but it was just pretty poorly done ####<neg><score>-2.0
(umm) It just (uhh) I didn't enjoy it ####<neg><score>-1.0
(umm) Young people in their twenties, thirties, or young children like teenagers, or even little (uhh) ten-year-olds they may enjoy this cause it's (uhh) I mean they may find the jokes funny but I didn't ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And so I wouldn't recommend to see it, but (umm) I guess the target audience would be people in my age group ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And (uhh) so, yeah ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
It was just (uhh) not adult humor I guess ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
That's it ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Didn't like it ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
Today I'm reviewing Hellboy Two ####<neu><score>0.0
Hi ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(uhh) I went to go see this movie (umm) and it was a big disappointment ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
It's currently playing in theaters right now ####<neu><score>0.0
But (uhh) when I saw it I was just unimpressed ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
From the trailers it looked (uhh) really action packed and exciting and (umm) kind of like a fairy tale with a darker side ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
And I just expected so much more from it ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) The little side jokes weren't funny at all, and the acting was just kind of so bland and just the overall presentation and performance of everything about this movie it just wasn't satisfactory for me ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
(umm) If I had to give it a rating I'd say it's a two out of five for me ####<neg><score>-2.0
So I didn't enjoy it a whole lot at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
Or if you're going to, go see matinee or something cheaper, seriously ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
I just, I think you're gonna get bored with it ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
It was in a way it was entertaining, in a way ####<pos><score>1.0
But really it's not worth your money ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
I I (stutter) think if you took your kids to go see it I think I think teenage audiences or them might enjoy it but really, it's that great a movie ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
I think it's (stutter) I think it's gonna fail (umm) on all levels ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
I mean the public is so used to special effects and computer effects now that we expect a lot more and we are being insulted by this movie ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
Everything about it, the special effects you can tell are fake and they're just trying to put so much action on you and and (stutter) CGI and special effects that like the movie and the plot just are completely lost and they're just trying to throw that to make up for it ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So really and it doesn't make up for it at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
So I do not recommend seeing this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
It's not good ####<neg><score>-1.0
It's just too much CGI, too much action and it's it's (stutter) over the top, it really is ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
So don't go see it in my opinion ####<neg><score>-2.0
Really I don't think it's good at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
Really, I mean just, you gotta go see it ####<pos><score>1.0
Do not go see it really ####<neg><score>-2.0
Do not waste your money on it ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
I'm gonna just come out right and say it ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It fails on every level possible ####<neg><score>-3.0
Do not go see this movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
They probably even shouldn't have made the second one to be honest ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
They shouldn't have not even made the movie ####<neg><score>-2.0
(umm) The casting, Rachel Weisz, is not a return a big problem there ####<neg><score>-2.0
And (uhh) there's, I can't really say one good thing about this movie ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
It really has an effect on the movie ####<neu><score>0.0
Big problem ####<neu><score>0.0
Other than that though I do not recommend this movie at all ####<neg><score>-2.0
So that's that's (stutter) one good thing I'd say about it ####<pos><score>1.0
Brendan Fraser just fails entirely ####<neg><score>-2.0
You don't love the characters as much cause the original actress that played Brendan Fraser's wife is not back ####<neg><score>-1.0
Just, it's terrible ####<neg><score>-2.0
He's not funny anymore, he's getting older, and the whole hero guy who tries to be funny with the one-liners, just just (stutter) stop ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
But you don't care, you really don't care about the tomb of the Dragon Emperor, this Dragon Emperor guy, you don't care ####<neg><score>-1.0
The plot it has nothing to do with the first or second Mummy anymore, which is you know, it's a good idea you know? Maybe get away from that ####<neu><score>0.0

And from that point on they've all been sort of been downhill ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
It was actually a fairly good movie ####<pos><score>2.0
So this has been Mike, saying hey, it's not good, don't see it ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
At least that might convince people, hey we should stop making these movies and maybe make something new for once ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
This is probably gonna go down as one of the dumbest movies ever made ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264

I, this isn't worth seeing ####<neg><score>-2.0
And so then you're just end with, you know, it's a political movie that's supposed to be like, oh, sort of satirical a little, but it's not very satirical ####<neg><score>-1.0
So what you end up with is they took a movie that, they took two movies, really, one that's sort of the Disney culture movie of, hey, look, we're making a family-friendly movie ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
But that fails because it's boring and can't hold anyone's attention, a child or an adult ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
And then they sort of had a sort of, hey, let's make a satirical political movie ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It's, there's nothing really exciting ####<neg><score>-2.0
Kevin Costner put in an all-right performance, but that's not enough to save the fact that this movie just isn't very good ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
You know? The premise is sort of laughable ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
The implementation is meh, thumbs down ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
And that sort of fails because it's not well done ####<neg><score>-2.0
They didn't satirize (stutter) anything to a sufficient degree ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
My name is Mike and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Swing Vote ####<neu><score>0.0
Hey, hey ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

As formality, here is my movie ticket ####<neu><score>0.0
He, you know, doesn't really give a care about anything ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
So the basic premise of this movie is as follows: Kevin Costner plays a character who is just sort of the (uhh) lame sort of loser ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
His daughter tries to get him to vote, so he goes and votes, and it causes a screw-up that la-de-dah-de-dah ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
And (uhh) so his life is just sort of passing him by ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Causing it so that his vote is the one that decides the presidential election ####<neu><score>0.0
Big surprise ####<neu><score>0.0
Well, that's a pretty unlikely-sounding premise, but let's run with it for a second ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
Okay ####<neu><score>0.0
Everyone is trying to get his opinion ####<neu><score>0.0
So then the rest of the movie falls upon the idea of, hey, look at him becoming blobbity-blobbity, look at him deciding the election, all the things that sort of happen ####<neg><score>-2.0
He starts to care a little ####<neu><score>0.0
He can't really decide, for a while, doesn't care ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
If anything, all it does is bore people of the American political system even more ####<neg><score>-2.0
And (uhh), well, it's supposed to sort of have the message that everyone's vote matters and voting is important and look at the American political system ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
If there was something duller than dirt, that would be it ####<neg><score>-3.0
This movie is dull, dull as dirt, duller than dirt ####<neg><score>-3.0
So, Swing Vote, Kevin Costner, one out of five ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
You know, it just sort of felt, so then you try to put it together and neither one succeeds ####<neg><score>-1.0
Goodbye ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
So, Mike here, saying one out of five ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
You know, the only reason I liked this movie in any way, shape, or form is because I like reviewing bad movies ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(umm) Pineapple Express (uhh) the movie got its name because that's supposedly the name of a new new (stutter) strain of marijuana ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
I just didn't really think this was the best movie to go see ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816

This movie involves a man (uhh) (stutter) or a hero, Jason, who is accused of killing his wife and he has to go to prison ####<neu><score>0.0
It's got some similarities but it's not really what I would call a remake of that movie ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
And (uhh) once there he gets involved in sort of a underground race to the death (uhh) with the prisoners ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
He's wrongly accused I should say ####<neu><score>0.0
There's a lot of explosions and a lot of violence, and (uhh) the action is pretty good but all in all I kind of miss the plot ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

So (uhh) I can't recommend this and I certainly wouldn't buy it ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
It's (uhh) nothing unusual but it is not always about effects it's about the storyline and the storyline is just boring ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

Is he a good guy or bad guy? He goes out and punches those who have done wrong, basically by hunting them down and killing them ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
The Punisher himself is kind of an avenging (uhh) angel, kind of in the grey area ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

Most of the Marvel movies have been pretty good in recent years and most of the comic book movies in general have been fairly well done ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
I was kind of disappointed ####<neg><score>-1.0
It seems it's always getting a new cast and a new direction and it's just not working for me ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
This one's kind of weak, this is the third time they've made a Punisher movie and second one in recent years ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
And if you really want to go that route, go watch Dark Shadows reruns somewhere on TV, they have to be out there somewhere ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
They're a lot better ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

The humor in the movie feels really forced, like they're trying too hard and the writing's not very good ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

The character played by Sean William Scott is pretty annoying ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
The movie is pretty formulaic, you know how the movies gonna end and I guess you could say that about a lot of movies in Hollywood but at least try to be funny along the way but this movie doesn't really deliver that ####<neg><score>-1.0
So, I would recommend looking somewhere else and not watching Role Models ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Sean William Scott is Stifler in every movie that he's in, and that might've been funny back when he made American Pie like ten years ago or however long it was but, when you play the same character in every movie it starts to wear thin and just wasn't that funny ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Also I went into this movie expecting at least a little bit of action considering the fact that it, it's (stutter) surrounded by a war and, you know, violence ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
He can do an Irish accent in Far and Away, I don't understand why he couldn't do a German accent in this ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368

In this case this happens at x=-1 and x=1, since the denominator of the left hand side of the inequality is zero there. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
But in fact you don’t need the graphs, as long as you keep the following in mind: given an inequality, you must find the x-values where both sides are equal, in this case x=-sqrt(2) and x=sqrt(2). But also find x-values where the functions involved are not defined or discontinuous. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
On each interval either the inequality holds for all points, or for none of them. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
These four points then divide the real line into five intervals. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
You can simply check at one point in each interval whether the inequality holds or not. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
The solutions to this inequality lie in the intervals where the blue graph is above green one. ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
And now you can see what went wrong: when we tried to solve the inequality, we found the x-values where the graphs intersect, but we forgot that the left hand side is not defined at two points on the real line. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Remember: the boundaries of these intervals can be points at which both sides are equal, that is, where the graphs intersect, but also points where one of the functions is not defined or discontinuous. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
That really matters here: you see that at these points, the inequality holds on one side, but not on the other. ####<neu><score>0.0

[Music] Hi, Welcome to Wave Domain ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Averages - very simple - take the total sales and divide by the count and that gives you a number that is the average ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Now, I refer to both of these terms quite a lot when i'm doing the trend analysis and looking at the sales data so i thought it would be good good idea to make sure that we're on the same page with what this means ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Cos what you're gonna do is you're going to line up all the sales in ascending order and go to that one that the halfway point and that's going to be your median ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Now, medians are a little bit more democratic ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Averages are very useful indicators but you tend to get blown around by those higher numbers at the top end ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Now they are much less skewed, medians, are much less skewed by really giant sales at the top end and so that sometimes is a much better indicator of what you might expect to get for one of your names on a typical sale ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

When it comes to presentations, the easiest way to apply contrast is in your presentation text. ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Your job as the presenter is to help the audience quickly understand what is important to them and not to make them guess. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

The basic EFT set up statement is 'Even though I have this issue' - is the first part, focussing on whatever the issue is you want to focus on - and the second bit, 'I deeply and completely accept myself' or 'I deeply and profoundly accept myself'.

I don't believe that at all!" So what can you say when you don't deeply and completely accept yourself? ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632

Mission Impossible Two, starring Tom Cruise ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
The second one was probably the best out of all three, the third one was just terrible, not even worth mentioning ####<neg><score>-2.0
The first one had a insanely convoluted plot and was just difficult to follow ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
Now one thing I thought was pretty cool about this movie was the technology they used called the facemaker ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
This one is a hundred and twenty-three minutes long, so it's pretty long, and it follows (uhh) Tom Cruise's character as he tries to stop the deadly Chimera virus from attacking the world ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
It looks really weird ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
(umm) It allows the characters to make an exact copy of someone's face and then sneak in somewhere and then pull it off, and you never expect it until they actually pull it off ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
So (uhh) if someone gives you the DVD watch it, but I wouldn't spend any money on it like I did ####<neg><score>-2.0
It has some funny moments but overall it's just not that great ####<neg><score>-1.3333333730697632
This was kind of a waste of money ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
Tonight I'm going to be reviewing a terrible movie called Killer Klowns From Outer Space ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264
Hi {sigh} ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
It was made by Orion Pictures Corporation ####<neu><score>0.0
Now this is pretty much, I mean it's released by MGM but it was a very independent sort of movie ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
It's rated PG-thirteen and it is about killer clowns who are from outer space and they land in a field near a small town and they proceed to take, take (stutter) over ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
It's very short, only eighty-six minutes long ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
But, I mean, as you can probably expect with a movie titled Killer Klowns From Outer Space the movie is just full of terrible acting and bad cinematography ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
And the movie also follows a group of teenagers who set out to destroy the clowns and reclaim what's rightfully theirs, their hometown ####<neu><score>0.0
So that I would just, I would give it a two out of five ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
It's a fun concept but they just didn't really pull it off that well ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
(umm) Supertroopers was still, very was still pretty realistic like yeah it's, it's (stutter) still comedy and it's far fetched ####<neg><score>-1.0
But overall the story is just, you know it's just campy and it's too cliche horror parody ####<neg><score>-2.0
But this people I mean, I mean (stutter) I don't know I guess you know horror is so far fetched with people come back to life but this one is just not very good ####<neg><score>-1.0
This movie is very bad I'm giving it two out of five stars ####<neg><score>-2.0

Supertroopers is one of my favorite movies and I'm really glad to know they're now making a sequel ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368

It follows the broken lizard gang as they own a resort in the Caribbean ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
(uhh) There are some humorous taunt moments in it ####<pos><score>1.0
(umm) (stutter) There instead of being a cop parody, this is a horror parody and I feel there have been enough horror parodies done the past few years and this one is not very, very good ####<neg><score>-1.6666666269302368
You could probably get it for under five dollars now, since it's so old and so bad ####<neg><score>-2.3333332538604736
So I didn't really like this DVD, a waste of fifteen dollars ####<neg><score>-2.6666667461395264

Cryptoequities can also be things like tied to tangible goods ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816

In some senses, in that case it's a bit centralized and requires trust upon the person declaring the asset but certainly is doesn't require trust on the part of the clearinghouse or the counterparty agent ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Maybe you have a bank of gold or copper or some such thing and you want to declare to the network that you are the holder of that repository, that it is yours but the equity itself is decentralized and it is declared on the network and it represents some fractional holding of that store of that traditional commodity ####<pos><score>1.0

That emotional engagement needs to migrate into rapport, empathy and trust. ####<pos><score>1.0
It’s critical that we pay attention to what is happening to customers and prospective customers in both the B2B and B2C markets. ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Both consumers and business buyers have learned to research, analyze, price, compare and purchase many of the products, services and business solutions they want online without any involvement by a salesperson. ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816

Home Inspector, if this was your house that you're purchasing, what would be your top priority?' ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Now this is kind of tricky because depending on how you word it, they may not be so inclined to answer ####<pos><score>1.0
If your house is perfect and there's nothing wrong with it, the home inspector is still going to find things wrong that will need to be fixed because they need to do their job and show that they are doing something for $500 ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
Because if they give you a report that is empty, that shows everything is good ####<pos><score>2.6666667461395264

I'll put a link in the description below so you can learn a little bit more about Discovery Elementary ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
It could be thousands of dollars, it could be hundreds of dollars, whatever the case may be, your safety is paramount ####<pos><score>1.0
Question number one: what is the biggest safety issue that you're seeing? Guys, you're going to be negotiating a lot of money in the home inspection ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
That should be your top priority ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
The absolute first question you need to be asking is, 'what is the biggest safety concern?' Question number two is, 'what is the biggest monetary fix that you see?' What is the biggest monetary item out there? And this one can be a little bit tricky because the home inspector might not know the exact cost but they are certainly going to know the most significant item ####<neu><score>0.0
And the safety issue might be as small as a couple GFCI outlets or it might be something as large as structure damage or the entire electrical needs to be redone or something of that nature ####<neg><score>-0.6666666865348816
If you're buying a house or a townhouse ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
That is number two ####<neu><score>0.0
They could range in value from $20 up to maybe $5,000 or even $10,000 ####<pos><score>1.0
You might have something like 20 - 25 items come up ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
But if you word it correctly, I think they can answer that ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
They may want to kind of excuse themselves and not get in the way of your purchase ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Because, let's face it ####<pos><score>1.0
And what sort of issues were kind of just put on the report to show that they were just doing their job ####<pos><score>1.0
And I think that would give a little bit of an insight to see what sort of issues are important ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
So now that they are no longer the inspector, they are the purchaser ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
A purchaser mindset, sort of change the framework, change the mindset around ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

Partially because the first book in the series, Devil in a Blue Dress, was made into a movie starring Denzel Washington ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

But if you bought the fund and the share price was ten dollars a share, and five years later you decide to sell the tax-free mutual fund, mutual bond fund, and the price is fifteen dollars a share, you are still going to owe capital gains tax on the difference between your selling price, fifteen and your purchase price, ten dollars. ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
Another important thing to note is that when they talk about a tax-free mutual fund, again we're referring to the interest income, you may buy a bond, tax-free bond mutual fund that's exempt from federal and state taxes, so you're not getting any interest income and paying taxes on that. ####<pos><score>1.0
For example, not all tax-free mutual funds that you're going to buy are going to be free from federal, state and local taxes. ####<neu><score>0.0
So you have to take a look at the documentation and read the perspectives to make sure that it truly would be for your situation and your residency free from federal, state and local taxes. ####<neu><score>0.0
So there are some things to consider when you're taking a look at a tax-free mutual fund to make sure it truly is going to be tax-free for your situation ,and that you do understand the tax ramifications for your situation. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

So the big innovation sort, if clean energy at lower costs that focus on costs and access to poor people. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

When you buy stock in a company, you're essentially becoming a part owner of that company ####<pos><score>1.0
To understand what a dividend is, you really just have to understand what it means to be a shareholder of a company ####<pos><score>1.3333333730697632
Because you're now a part owner of the business, you're entitled to some of the rights and privileges of being an owner in the business and that includes the profit ####<pos><score>1.6666666269302368
You're giving them your money in exchange for a piece of their company ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
You don't have to do anything, all you need to do is purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date and then you will receive your payout proportional to the number of shares you own on the dividend payout date ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

It's important to remember when you're chasing these dividends that rate reflects risk ####<pos><score>0.6666666865348816
Like with all investing, there are associated risks, the main one of dividend investing being that the company could reduce or even eliminate its dividend entirely ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408

One example, I've heard the comparison between Catholics and Protestants, I've heard the statement that Catholics believe in transubstantiation, which means that when they take communion, the bread and wine actually becomes the body and blood of Christ, whereas Protestants "don't" believe in transubstantiation, they believe that it's more of a symbolic meaning when they take communion. ####<neg><score>-0.3333333432674408
What I've taken from this is that when I hear that there's an official belief associated with a religion or a denomination, I don't assume that everyone in that group holds that belief, and I'm very cautious about making statements like that. ####<pos><score>0.3333333432674408
