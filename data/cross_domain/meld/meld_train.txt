also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system. ####<meld>neutral
You mustve had your hands full. ####<meld>neutral
That I did. That I did. ####<meld>neutral
So lets talk a little bit about your duties. ####<meld>neutral
My duties?  All right. ####<meld>surprise
Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties. ####<meld>neutral
I see. ####<meld>neutral
But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them. ####<meld>neutral
Good to know. ####<meld>neutral
We can go into detail ####<meld>neutral
No dont I beg of you! ####<meld>fear
All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Absolutely.  You can relax ####<meld>neutral
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? ####<meld>surprise
You know? Forget it! ####<meld>sadness

Um-mm, yeah right! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! ####<meld>surprise

He was with her when he wrote this poem. ####<meld>neutral
Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. ####<meld>neutral
Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' ####<meld>neutral
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. ####<meld>sadness
Done. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise

Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Howd did it go? ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up. ####<meld>joy
Im so proud of you. ####<meld>joy
Me too! ####<meld>joy

Oh-ho-ho, yeah! ####<meld>joy
Which part exactly? ####<meld>neutral
The whole thing! Can we go? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics. ####<meld>anger
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part! ####<meld>joy
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part? ####<meld>neutral
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic. ####<meld>surprise
You fell asleep!! ####<meld>anger
There was no kangaroo! ####<meld>anger
They didnt take any of my suggestions! ####<meld>anger
Thats for coming buddy. ####<meld>neutral
Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Dont go! ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Im so sorry! ####<meld>sadness
Look! ####<meld>surprise
This guy fell asleep! ####<meld>anger
He fell asleep too! ####<meld>anger
Be mad at him! ####<meld>anger
Or, call an ambulance. ####<meld>anger
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. ####<meld>neutral
What?! What is with everybody? Its Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day! ####<meld>anger
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. ####<meld>neutral
See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity ####<meld>neutral
Okay, thats enough honey! ####<meld>neutral
I dont know.  Let me see the ring. ####<meld>neutral
Great! Okay, here. ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And ####<meld>joy
What've you been up to? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. ####<meld>neutral

Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her. ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
I'm back. ####<meld>neutral
So, are we gonna get together or what? ####<meld>neutral
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish? ####<meld>neutral
Great, I'll see you then. ####<meld>neutral
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. ####<meld>joy
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob." ####<meld>neutral
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god. You are pure evil. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this ####<meld>anger
Nobody! ####<meld>anger
Nobody respects the bucket! ####<meld>anger
You wouldn't believe what people put in here! ####<meld>anger
Look! ####<meld>anger
Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you? ####<meld>anger
No. ####<meld>neutral
This is my wedding. ####<meld>neutral

Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time. ####<meld>joy
Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now? ####<meld>disgust
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Whats wrong with you? ####<meld>disgust
Nothing! ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. ####<meld>fear
But um, I dont think its anything serious. ####<meld>neutral
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor! ####<meld>surprise
No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! ####<meld>fear
Thats a hernia. ####<meld>disgust
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s! ####<meld>anger
I love your place! Where is this guy from? ####<meld>joy
Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs. ####<meld>surprise
So much more. ####<meld>neutral
Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young. ####<meld>neutral
Okay ####<meld>neutral
But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Really. ####<meld>neutral
You dont think this is too fast. ####<meld>neutral
Get Out! ####<meld>anger
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, please!  So, what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God, wh-what happened? ####<meld>surprise
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! ####<meld>sadness
I knew that was him! ####<meld>anger
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, you ok? ####<meld>neutral
I guess. ####<meld>sadness
There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. ####<meld>neutral
I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else. ####<meld>neutral
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later? ####<meld>neutral
Or we could throw you both in ####<meld>joy
Ok, gentlemen! ####<meld>anger
Please! ####<meld>anger
Aren't we a little old for this? ####<meld>anger
I mean, we're scientists, right? ####<meld>neutral
We're academics. ####<meld>anger
And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. ####<meld>joy
GO, GO, GO! ####<meld>joy
Go, go, go! ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat! ####<meld>joy
Oy!! ####<meld>disgust
Whats with all this sand? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later. ####<meld>anger
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up. ####<meld>joy
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference? ####<meld>neutral
Rach? What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary! ####<meld>fear
It's a diaper commercial. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!! ####<meld>fear
Pizza delivery! ####<meld>joy
I'll get it! I will get that! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, the ball thing. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! ####<meld>joy
Uhh, ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear

No! ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>joy
You guys were totally right! ####<meld>joy
This is so much better than the first time we went out. ####<meld>joy
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
That was so awkward, we were really nervous. ####<meld>neutral
Didnt you sleep together? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that really calms me down. ####<meld>neutral
And! ####<meld>joy
We have so much in common! ####<meld>joy
She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do. ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
How does she do that? ####<meld>surprise
I cannot sleep in a public place. ####<meld>neutral
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. ####<meld>joy
Oh! What what what! ...Hi. ####<meld>surprise
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. ####<meld>neutral
What's going on with you? ####<meld>surprise
I got no sleep last night! ####<meld>anger
Why? ####<meld>neutral
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, and deaf. ####<meld>neutral
So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. ####<meld>neutral
You have no idea how loud they are! ####<meld>disgust
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Ew! What is that? Something exploded! ####<meld>disgust
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you? ####<meld>neutral
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking? ####<meld>surprise
Breathe, breathe, breathe. ####<meld>neutral
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead. ####<meld>surprise
Okay! You dont think I thought of that? ####<meld>anger
How can you not know which one? ####<meld>surprise
I mean thats unbelievable. ####<meld>joy
I mean, was it Gina? ####<meld>neutral
Which one is Gina? ####<meld>neutral
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, no, thats Dina. ####<meld>neutral
You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny. ####<meld>neutral
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. ####<meld>neutral
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. ####<meld>neutral
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you. ####<meld>joy
Really!? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. ####<meld>neutral
I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What? ####<meld>joy
What should I wear, now Im all nervous. ####<meld>fear

I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful. ####<meld>joy
: Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball. ####<meld>joy
Oh well, okay, good luck. ####<meld>joy

: Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me. ####<meld>neutral
No, Im good. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this? ####<meld>surprise
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so ####<meld>neutral
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition? ####<meld>surprise
Who knows? ####<meld>neutral
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much. ####<meld>neutral
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later! ####<meld>joy
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Actually, that can't happen. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. ####<meld>neutral
So it'll be either you two  or you two. ####<meld>neutral
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, it is. ####<meld>neutral
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new. ####<meld>joy
Please! ####<meld>anger
Are you kidding? ####<meld>anger
I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am. ####<meld>anger
And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you. ####<meld>joy
I think youve got concussion. ####<meld>fear
No, no, Im serious. Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you? ####<meld>fear
Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not. ####<meld>sadness
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David. ####<meld>surprise
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do". ####<meld>joy
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. ####<meld>neutral
David is going to propose to Phoebe. ####<meld>joy
What?  Why? ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, we have talked about this. ####<meld>anger
You are not supposed to give people advice! ####<meld>anger
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke? ####<meld>anger
I ####<meld>neutral
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! ####<meld>anger
She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone ####<meld>anger
Man, that's some ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's not what you want... ####<meld>neutral
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller. ####<meld>neutral
It-its great to meet you Paul. ####<meld>joy
I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens. ####<meld>neutral
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens. ####<meld>neutral
So Ross, what your problem? ####<meld>anger
Eh-whExcuse me? ####<meld>surprise
Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age? ####<meld>anger
Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny. ####<meld>fear
I ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I can, I can see that. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind. ####<meld>fear
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute. ####<meld>anger
Daddy! ####<meld>surprise
Oh well, its not on TV yet. ####<meld>neutral
Well, then its not on the wall yet. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? ####<meld>neutral
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that havent been cleaned yet? ####<meld>neutral
Ooooohh! ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Was it...? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there. ####<meld>neutral
"Ooo," what? ####<meld>surprise
Uma Thurman. ####<meld>neutral

Guys? ####<meld>anger
Guys? ####<meld>anger
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her. ####<meld>neutral
Feminist issue. That's where I went! ####<meld>neutral
She is gonna hate me. ####<meld>fear

Yep! That's hilarious! ####<meld>joy
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too. ####<meld>neutral
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily. ####<meld>neutral
What?! You totally get embarrassed! ####<meld>surprise
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are. ####<meld>neutral
Is that so? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am ####<meld>disgust
I cant believe it! ####<meld>surprise

I rode a bike! ####<meld>joy
I never thought Id be able to do that! ####<meld>joy
Thank you Ross. ####<meld>joy
Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them. ####<meld>joy
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you two are-are my I mean, Im lucky to have just one good ####<meld>neutral

Call it even?! ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Well, Im gonna go get these  in some water. ####<meld>neutral
Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding? ####<meld>surprise

Huh? ####<meld>surprise
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! ####<meld>anger
I talk to you and nothin. ####<meld>anger
You look at me, and its nothin. ####<meld>anger
Nothing. ####<meld>anger
Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice. ####<meld>joy
I have a question about this scene. ####<meld>neutral
Yes? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor. ####<meld>disgust
Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey, how about this one. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, its says so in the script! ####<meld>anger
Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch. ####<meld>anger
It doesnt say that in the script. ####<meld>anger
It does in mine! ####<meld>anger
I cant ####<meld>anger
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. ####<meld>anger
Yknow who has a great video camera? ####<meld>neutral
Greg and Jenny? ####<meld>neutral
Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em. ####<meld>neutral
Lets call em. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs! ####<meld>joy
Hello?  Eighth street deli? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place. ####<meld>disgust
Uh sorry, wrong number. ####<meld>fear
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Hello?   Its the deli again! ####<meld>surprise
All right! Ill have a sandwich! ####<meld>joy
I dont think this numbers right! ####<meld>sadness
Oh come on!! ####<meld>sadness
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now ####<meld>sadness
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma? ####<meld>surprise
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. ####<meld>neutral
Sure. So how long you been... ####<meld>neutral
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships? ####<meld>neutral
Since then?! ####<meld>surprise
No, it's only been six years. ####<meld>neutral
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ####<meld>neutral
...Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Y'ever been in love? ####<meld>neutral
...I d'know. ####<meld>neutral
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes. ####<meld>neutral
You're one to talk. ####<meld>disgust
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. ####<meld>neutral
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma. ####<meld>disgust
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you. ####<meld>surprise
Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick? ####<meld>neutral
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Rach, how was work? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair. ####<meld>neutral
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. ####<meld>neutral
Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and... ####<meld>neutral
Something wrong? ####<meld>neutral
No. Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that's it? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Dude, I am sorry about what I said! ####<meld>sadness
No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name! ####<meld>disgust
Its not that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name. ####<meld>anger
So, youre just Bing? ####<meld>neutral
Because we won our apartment back! ####<meld>joy
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace! ####<meld>surprise
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four! ####<meld>anger
I dont know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha! ####<meld>surprise
All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high! ####<meld>anger
Uh-huh, not as high as It worked! King! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah baby! ####<meld>joy
But, we pick again! We pick again! ####<meld>joy
Why?! ####<meld>neutral
I dont know! ####<meld>fear
Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby! ####<meld>joy
Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back! ####<meld>surprise
No they didnt! ####<meld>joy
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil? ####<meld>neutral
It's gonna be worth it. ####<meld>neutral
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right? ####<meld>neutral
Women love guys who love babies. ####<meld>neutral
It's that whole sensitive thing. ####<meld>neutral
Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe one of them will break away. ####<meld>neutral
No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. ####<meld>joy
All right, gimme the baby. ####<meld>neutral
No, I got him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, seriously you want him? ####<meld>surprise
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me? ####<meld>surprise
You wanna smell him? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head. ####<meld>joy
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? ####<meld>joy
Well, we are great guys. ####<meld>neutral
Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Well, not really. ####<meld>neutral
I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. ####<meld>neutral
Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou. ####<meld>anger
Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. What-what should I do? ####<meld>fear
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. ####<meld>neutral
I mean whats more important? ####<meld>neutral
What people think or how you feel, huh? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, you gotta follow your heart. ####<meld>neutral
Joey that is so sweet. ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday? ####<meld>neutral
I couldnt do it. ####<meld>sadness
You couldnt do it?! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Youre going out with her again! ####<meld>surprise
Going out with who? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Dana Keystone from college. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh ####<meld>surprise
No, that was Dana Caplin. ####<meld>neutral
Joey! You didnt even know her! ####<meld>surprise
Ah whatever! ####<meld>anger
Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! ####<meld>joy
Dont touch him! ####<meld>anger
Okay! ####<meld>surprise
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. ####<meld>neutral
I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. ####<meld>fear
Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! ####<meld>fear
Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! ####<meld>sadness
I mean, I love-I love this little guy! ####<meld>joy
Ah-ah!! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right? ####<meld>surprise
Here you go! ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Stupid! ####<meld>anger
I cant believe it! ####<meld>surprise
God! ####<meld>anger
Hey, how you doin? ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier... ####<meld>sadness
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed. ####<meld>neutral
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. ####<meld>disgust
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office? ####<meld>anger
You had no ####<meld>anger
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I. ####<meld>anger
But I told you, I didnt have the time! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel. ####<meld>anger
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? ####<meld>anger
You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? ####<meld>anger
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, I have to tell you something. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
But I cant tell you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Does it have to do with Joey? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed? ####<meld>neutral
No, but lets come back to that later! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Richard! ####<meld>joy
Actually, Im not here to complement the chef. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. ####<meld>neutral
Like I have nothing better to do! ####<meld>neutral
So whats up? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it was great seeing you the other night. ####<meld>joy
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that? ####<meld>neutral
No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you. ####<meld>joy
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay. ####<meld>disgust
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen? ####<meld>sadness
Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant! ####<meld>anger
Joey, I am scared to death about this. ####<meld>fear
But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help. ####<meld>fear
And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time. ####<meld>neutral
You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap. ####<meld>joy
Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me? ####<meld>anger
Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister! ####<meld>sadness
And youre my big brother! ####<meld>joy
I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world. ####<meld>neutral
Im not even scared to tell mom and dad. ####<meld>neutral
I was scared of telling you. ####<meld>fear
Well Id be scared of them, but all right. ####<meld>fear
Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. ####<meld>sadness
I want him to have his uncle. ####<meld>sadness
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey? ####<meld>sadness
Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey! ####<meld>joy
Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us. ####<meld>joy
Thats right! By his uncle too! ####<meld>joy
And by you. ####<meld>joy
Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment. ####<meld>neutral
Come here! ####<meld>joy
No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?! ####<meld>anger
I had a really nice time tonight. ####<meld>joy
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out. ####<meld>joy
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch. ####<meld>neutral
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw ####<meld>surprise
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up! ####<meld>surprise
Like it would help. ####<meld>neutral
You are so bad! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you. ####<meld>joy
Uh, it was very nice meeting you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre. ####<meld>surprise
Hi Mom, it's Jill. ####<meld>neutral
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule. ####<meld>neutral
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule. ####<meld>neutral
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was ####<meld>joy
Are you seeing anybody right now? ####<meld>neutral
Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out. ####<meld>fear
Im not-Im not-Im not gay! ####<meld>fear
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy? ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
That sounds great! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended. ####<meld>anger
Theres gravy? ####<meld>surprise
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. ####<meld>neutral
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
I think I left a donut up here. ####<meld>neutral
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so Im happy. ####<meld>neutral
Great job team! ####<meld>joy
Tomorrow at 8:30. ####<meld>neutral
Phil! ####<meld>joy
Nice job. ####<meld>joy
Stevens! ####<meld>joy
Way to go! ####<meld>joy
Joel-burg, you maniac! ####<meld>joy
I love ya! ####<meld>joy
Bing! ####<meld>joy
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident. ####<meld>neutral
Of course, you did. ####<meld>joy
Forgot something else too ya bastard! ####<meld>joy
Well, what about you? ####<meld>neutral
Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya? ####<meld>neutral
No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous. ####<meld>sadness
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you? ####<meld>joy
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do! ####<meld>sadness
Now get on out of here, you! ####<meld>joy
Hey Bob. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today? ####<meld>joy
If I see him, Ill ask. ####<meld>neutral
Toby! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Oh then you know each other. ####<meld>neutral
Were on a semi-first name basis. ####<meld>neutral
What do you think of adding him to our team? ####<meld>neutral
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes. ####<meld>surprise
Really? They love him down on six. ####<meld>surprise
But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! ####<meld>joy
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? ####<meld>neutral
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in. ####<meld>joy
You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux! ####<meld>anger
So? ####<meld>neutral
SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!" ####<meld>anger
Well then we still have a problem. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
With what? ####<meld>neutral
Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies. ####<meld>neutral
Oo! You should have one of us do it! ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, were getting ####<meld>neutral
No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff! ####<meld>joy
I call it!! ####<meld>joy
What?! No! It was my idea! ####<meld>anger
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us. ####<meld>neutral
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?! ####<meld>anger
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva! ####<meld>neutral
See, I see.... big passion in your future. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
I do. ####<meld>neutral
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up] ####<meld>joy
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. ####<meld>neutral
Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side. ####<meld>neutral
What?!?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill. ####<meld>neutral
You can spill. In the sink. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening. ####<meld>sadness
I love you, too. ####<meld>joy
Aww, good.  What? ####<meld>joy
What? Im just said. ####<meld>sadness
No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
I would love to live with you Ross.. thats-thats great! Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out. ####<meld>neutral
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! ####<meld>joy
I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. ####<meld>sadness
You just saved me! ####<meld>joy
Youre my hero! ####<meld>joy
Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! ####<meld>joy
Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya? ####<meld>joy
No. ####<meld>neutral
No, I wont. ####<meld>neutral
But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. ####<meld>neutral
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! ####<meld>anger
...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready? ####<meld>anger
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. ####<meld>joy
Lose the robe. ####<meld>neutral
Me? ####<meld>surprise
That's great. ####<meld>joy
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, I'm still working on mine. ####<meld>neutral
That's it? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, it was really hard. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, you weren't there. ####<meld>anger
Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice! ####<meld>joy
Pretty nice? ####<meld>neutral
Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this. ####<meld>neutral
We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe. ####<meld>neutral
You gotta take the canoe! ####<meld>anger
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away! ####<meld>neutral
Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe! ####<meld>anger
Good for you!! ####<meld>anger
Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen. ####<meld>neutral
One ticket to Yemen? ####<meld>surprise
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry sir, I dont understand. ####<meld>surprise
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with? ####<meld>neutral
Are you travelling with a child? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but this is the last time. ####<meld>neutral
With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. ####<meld>joy
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen. ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hows she doing? ####<meld>neutral
She? ####<meld>surprise
Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly. ####<meld>neutral
Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive. ####<meld>neutral
Well sensitive is important, pick him. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh sure, go with the sissy. ####<meld>disgust
Jason is not a sissy! ####<meld>anger
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler. ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way. ####<meld>neutral
I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve. ####<meld>neutral
It was an amazing night. ####<meld>joy
It was. It was an amazing night. ####<meld>joy
You think it looked amazing? ####<meld>sadness
Do we have a name yet? ####<meld>neutral
No, not yet. ####<meld>neutral
Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green. ####<meld>neutral
Hello baby girl. ####<meld>joy
Ah-ha, nowhere to run! ####<meld>joy
I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over ####<meld>anger
No Rachel! They got here first! ####<meld>anger
Why is Ross doing that? ####<meld>neutral
DANGER ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women! ####<meld>surprise
No thats all right. Dont worry about it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain! ####<meld>disgust
Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys! ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Look! ####<meld>neutral
Ive never lived like this before. ####<meld>disgust
I know. ####<meld>neutral
All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes! ####<meld>joy
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so ####<meld>surprise
Also so ####<meld>neutral
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"! ####<meld>neutral
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff! ####<meld>neutral
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you. ####<meld>neutral
About what? ####<meld>neutral
He's planning your birthday party. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! I love him! ####<meld>joy
You'd better act surprised. ####<meld>fear
About what? ####<meld>neutral
My surprise party! ####<meld>joy
What surprise party? ####<meld>surprise
Oh stop it. Joey already told me. ####<meld>joy
Well, he didn't tell me. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing. ####<meld>neutral
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything. ####<meld>anger
No, you are not. We tell you stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Yuh-huh! ####<meld>anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. ####<meld>anger
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. ####<meld>anger
Looks like I was second to last. ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! Hes your father.  he should be at the wedding. ####<meld>anger
I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years. ####<meld>disgust
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?! ####<meld>sadness
Its not like we run in the same circles. ####<meld>neutral
I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas. ####<meld>disgust
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles. ####<meld>neutral
Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress. ####<meld>disgust
So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. ####<meld>neutral
Hello! Whos in there? ####<meld>neutral
How ya doin? ####<meld>neutral
Who in the hell are you? ####<meld>anger
I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh? ####<meld>neutral
No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us! ####<meld>fear
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride! ####<meld>anger
Im not gonna marry Chandler! ####<meld>anger
Not after this! ####<meld>anger
Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo. ####<meld>neutral
I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry I'm late, but I left late. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
So Pheebs, what is the book about? ####<meld>neutral
I thought you said you read it in high school. ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about? ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here? ####<meld>neutral
I thought you didn't smoke. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? ####<meld>neutral
And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" ####<meld>surprise
But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time. ####<meld>neutral
We get high. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, me too. ####<meld>neutral
I'm kidding. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, me too. ####<meld>joy
Oh, are you sure you're ok? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Does it still hurt? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>sadness
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this. ####<meld>joy
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, how'd it go? ####<meld>neutral
Excellent. ####<meld>joy
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves. ####<meld>joy
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way. ####<meld>joy
You know what? You are right. I ####<meld>neutral
Good for you Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean ####<meld>neutral
This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired! ####<meld>anger
Its 6:00. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well. ####<meld>neutral
Handling it? ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean, handling it? ####<meld>joy
Theres nothing to handle. ####<meld>joy
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway! ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
Come on! ####<meld>anger
They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous! ####<meld>disgust
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off. ####<meld>neutral
Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres. ####<meld>joy
What the hell is this?! ####<meld>surprise
What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?! ####<meld>anger
This sucks! ####<meld>anger
All right, whats my next present? ####<meld>neutral
All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? ####<meld>neutral
Enhh ####<meld>neutral
Ive got canned goods. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole! ####<meld>surprise
Excellent hole, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no! No!! My hole!! ####<meld>surprise
Ow!! Ow!!! ####<meld>disgust
What?! What?!! What is it?! ####<meld>surprise
My drinking? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I mustve said that after you left. ####<meld>neutral
Said what? Exactly. ####<meld>fear
That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person! ####<meld>disgust
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! ####<meld>fear
If youre gonna get all sensitive about it! ####<meld>anger
I dont want to lose you. ####<meld>sadness
What if I, create a position for you? ####<meld>neutral
Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department. ####<meld>neutral
Say more things like that. ####<meld>joy
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow. ####<meld>joy
Id need an expense account. ####<meld>neutral
Done! ####<meld>joy
And an assistant. ####<meld>neutral
Sophie, get in here! ####<meld>joy
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses. ####<meld>joy
Oh my! ####<meld>surprise
They're male nurses. ####<meld>neutral
Not in my head. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say? ####<meld>joy
Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
What are you talking about?! ####<meld>surprise
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. ####<meld>anger
I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. ####<meld>neutral
Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, why don't you give ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some ####<meld>neutral
Yep! There's always room for ####<meld>neutral

Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Lets bring it in. ####<meld>neutral
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me. ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
That almost hit me in the face. ####<meld>anger
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding. ####<meld>joy
Oh boy, me too! ####<meld>joy
Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>fear
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?! ####<meld>neutral
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature! ####<meld>anger
Thats me! Come on! ####<meld>joy
Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch. ####<meld>neutral
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill. ####<meld>neutral
Shrill?! The wedding is back on! ####<meld>anger
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Nice to meet you! ####<meld>joy
Nice to meet you too. ####<meld>neutral
So, are you ready to go? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! ####<meld>anger
Ill be right with you. ####<meld>neutral
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
You can take it off. ####<meld>neutral
Just slice that baby right off! ####<meld>fear
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
Well that's not a third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
No? ####<meld>surprise
First of all, it's on your ass. ####<meld>neutral
Well then, what is it?! ####<meld>surprise
Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment? ####<meld>neutral
I'm with Hamilton! ####<meld>neutral
He's good with rear things, bring him in too. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, this is great wine. ####<meld>joy
Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona. ####<meld>joy
I studied for a year in Barcelona. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking ####<meld>neutral
I love hiking! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo ####<meld>joy
So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married. ####<meld>surprise
Oh we-we didnt. ####<meld>joy
No-no. We ####<meld>fear
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all. ####<meld>neutral
Why?!! ####<meld>surprise
Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well then shut me up. ####<meld>neutral
Just tell me how. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. ####<meld>fear
Let it go, Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. ####<meld>neutral
Do you all promise? ####<meld>neutral
Chandler? Do you promise to be good? ####<meld>neutral
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Dear Ms. Buffay. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you for calling attention to our error. ####<meld>neutral
We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. ####<meld>neutral

Honey, both yours. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing! ####<meld>joy
Yeah? The work problem? ####<meld>neutral
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again. ####<meld>joy
What problem did you tell him you had? ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties? ####<meld>neutral
No thanks, Mom! ####<meld>disgust
Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha! ####<meld>anger
Very good,  so good. ####<meld>joy
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic. ####<meld>joy
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call. ####<meld>sadness
I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club. ####<meld>sadness
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont! ####<meld>sadness
Come on! Look where you are!! ####<meld>joy
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris. ####<meld>neutral
Remember, a virgin for me please. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you think it will help. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
That was a test! ####<meld>fear
In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! ####<meld>fear
And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice ####<meld>fear
You should! How is she? ####<meld>surprise
Ohhh!! ####<meld>anger
I think somebody needs another lap dance. ####<meld>joy
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg. ####<meld>neutral
You do? ####<meld>surprise
You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman. ####<meld>surprise
That and arrogance. ####<meld>anger
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! How was sailing? ####<meld>joy
Wow thanks! ####<meld>joy
Joe? ####<meld>fear
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Uh, youve had a lot of sex right? ####<meld>neutral
When? Today? Some, not a lot. ####<meld>surprise
Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt. ####<meld>fear
There huhhmm, there-there was an incident. ####<meld>fear
Dont worry about that man, that happens. ####<meld>neutral
Its happened to you? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Once. ####<meld>neutral
Well, whatd you do? ####<meld>surprise
I did it anyway. ####<meld>neutral
Sup? Sup dude? ####<meld>neutral
Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me. ####<meld>fear
So youre playing a little ####<meld>neutral
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19. ####<meld>disgust
Come on man, really how old?! ####<meld>surprise
Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear! ####<meld>disgust
And they knew about it? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about? ####<meld>surprise
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is! ####<meld>anger
The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer. ####<meld>disgust
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right? ####<meld>neutral
Do you always have to bring him here? ####<meld>anger
I didn't wanna leave him alone. ####<meld>neutral
Alright? ####<meld>neutral
We- we had our first fight this morning. ####<meld>neutral
I think it has to do with my working late. ####<meld>neutral
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that'd be great! ####<meld>joy
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie. ####<meld>neutral
Check this out. ####<meld>neutral
It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! ####<meld>surprise
"Its almost as good as being there." ####<meld>neutral
Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear! ####<meld>joy
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood! ####<meld>joy
Uh, may I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed. ####<meld>neutral
Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller. ####<meld>neutral
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king. ####<meld>neutral
Nobody sees the king! ####<meld>anger
Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! You cant go back there! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a ####<meld>sadness
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. ####<meld>neutral
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India. ####<meld>neutral
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea. ####<meld>joy
Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise. ####<meld>neutral
No, I just I think that its too soon. ####<meld>joy
No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven. ####<meld>neutral
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. ####<meld>neutral
And now you want that money back. ####<meld>surprise
Exactly. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? ####<meld>joy
Its not a real game! I made it up! ####<meld>anger
Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. ####<meld>joy
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
But I can see through your sheet. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, that's her. ####<meld>neutral
But y'know what? ####<meld>neutral
Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway. ####<meld>sadness
Why? ####<meld>neutral
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something. ####<meld>sadness
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left! ####<meld>surprise
No. No. No. She lives on the ####<meld>neutral
No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. ####<meld>neutral
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. ####<meld>neutral
You've been counting wrong. ####<meld>neutral
I did ####<meld>anger
Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this. ####<meld>fear
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. ####<meld>joy
Why? Do you have the answers written on there? ####<meld>surprise
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me. ####<meld>neutral
All right, lets do it. ####<meld>fear
All right, gentlemen, youre up first. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie? ####<meld>neutral
Big fat goalie. ####<meld>neutral
Correct. Rachel claims ####<meld>neutral
Dangerous Liaisons ####<meld>neutral
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is... ####<meld>neutral
Weekend at Bernies ####<meld>neutral
Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, come on, we can be guys! ####<meld>joy
No you cant. ####<meld>joy
You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long. ####<meld>disgust
Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!! ####<meld>anger
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. ####<meld>surprise
You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game. ####<meld>fear
Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men. ####<meld>neutral
Pete, can I get you something else? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out. ####<meld>neutral
Havent you and I covered that topic? ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food. ####<meld>joy
Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth. ####<meld>joy
And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. ####<meld>disgust
Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? ####<meld>neutral
I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean. ####<meld>disgust
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. ####<meld>disgust
I mean really, think about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ho-ho, I will. ####<meld>neutral
I believe I read that somewhere! ####<meld>surprise
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ####<meld>anger
Okay? ####<meld>anger
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... ####<meld>anger
It's not funny! ####<meld>anger
I respectfully disagree. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page! ####<meld>anger
Who cares? Nobody reads those things ####<meld>neutral
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today. ####<meld>anger
I don't have a page. ####<meld>neutral
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!! ####<meld>anger
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. ####<meld>joy
Okay, what is in here? Rocks? ####<meld>surprise
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. ####<meld>neutral
So, rocks. ####<meld>disgust
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. ####<meld>sadness
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little? ####<meld>joy
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move. ####<meld>joy
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice ####<meld>sadness
You ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up! ####<meld>joy
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised? ####<meld>joy
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, its time to go. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? ####<meld>neutral
Twice? ####<meld>neutral
Well thats ambitious. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, uh, you can ignore that. ####<meld>neutral
Thats Carol with your son! ####<meld>surprise
Mornings here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the mornings here! The mornings here! ####<meld>joy

Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor! ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? I am ####<meld>neutral

Yep! I sure know how to pick em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this! ####<meld>sadness
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too. ####<meld>anger

Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Transit Authority? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, hello. ####<meld>neutral
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, here's the deal. ####<meld>neutral
We lost a carseat on a bus today. ####<meld>neutral
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and there was a baby in it. ####<meld>neutral
He wants to talk to you again. ####<meld>neutral

Good evening, sir. ####<meld>neutral
My name is Ross Geller. ####<meld>neutral
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. ####<meld>neutral
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry. ####<meld>neutral
I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you. ####<meld>joy
Man, I wish I was naked. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, this-this looks so great. ####<meld>joy
That is how God intended it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! ####<meld>anger
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! ####<meld>anger
Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! ####<meld>joy
Okay, you go! ####<meld>anger
My turn? What-what are you talking about? ####<meld>surprise
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler. ####<meld>disgust

Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out. ####<meld>joy
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone. ####<meld>anger
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most ####<meld>neutral
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler. ####<meld>anger

A test?!! ####<meld>surprise
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!! ####<meld>joy
Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla? ####<meld>neutral
Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him. ####<meld>neutral
Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put. ####<meld>neutral
I think its best sir. ####<meld>neutral
But we really do need to find someone up here. ####<meld>neutral
The work is starting to pile up. ####<meld>neutral
Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a good one. ####<meld>neutral

Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, for you! ####<meld>joy
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God! ####<meld>surprise
That's ####<meld>neutral
Hey, I've been honing! ####<meld>anger
What was with the dishes? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh.. ####<meld>fear
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? ####<meld>fear
I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. ####<meld>anger
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here! ####<meld>anger
Great, now he's waving back. ####<meld>disgust
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. ####<meld>disgust
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. ####<meld>disgust
It creeps me out! ####<meld>anger
I feel like I can't do stuff! ####<meld>anger
What kinda stuff? ####<meld>joy
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked. ####<meld>disgust
You cook naked? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. ####<meld>neutral
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that. ####<meld>surprise
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps. ####<meld>neutral
Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know. ####<meld>sadness
Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to. ####<meld>neutral
You think you know me so well. ####<meld>anger
Well, dont cha wanna? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well I do know you. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what I said. ####<meld>neutral
Well so? ####<meld>neutral
I cant. ####<meld>sadness
I cant. ####<meld>sadness
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone. ####<meld>sadness
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? ####<meld>neutral
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal. ####<meld>neutral
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. ####<meld>joy
Nuh-uh. ####<meld>fear
Yuh-huh. ####<meld>joy
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what? ####<meld>surprise
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. ####<meld>disgust
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my ####<meld>anger
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one? ####<meld>anger
That's the rule. ####<meld>neutral
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! ####<meld>anger
How'd you get to that? ####<meld>anger
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio ####<meld>anger
You knew about that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, ok, How about if we split it? ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean, like, buy it together? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah ####<meld>neutral
You think we're ready for something like that? ####<meld>neutral
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out? ####<meld>neutral
Why, are you moving out? ####<meld>surprise
I'm not moving out. ####<meld>neutral
You'd tell me if you were moving out right ####<meld>fear
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip... ####<meld>neutral
Aw, I know all about Kip! ####<meld>anger
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly. ####<meld>anger
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? ####<meld>sadness
Aw, don't do that ####<meld>sadness
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment. ####<meld>sadness
Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you. ####<meld>neutral
No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry! ####<meld>fear
Aw forget it, its from ####<meld>neutral
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!! ####<meld>anger
Yknow this is actually not a great time for me. ####<meld>sadness
Okay! So, well just stay married. ####<meld>joy
Yes, exactly! ####<meld>joy
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! ####<meld>joy
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more. ####<meld>joy
What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>anger
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! ####<meld>joy
Its ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, okay, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Youre right. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Im asking you to do me a favor. ####<meld>neutral
You are asking me to be your wife! ####<meld>anger
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. ####<meld>joy
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it? ####<meld>neutral
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her- ####<meld>neutral
-leg? ####<meld>neutral
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch. ####<meld>neutral
You actually broke her watch? ####<meld>surprise
Barry, I'm sorry... ####<meld>sadness
I am so sorry... ####<meld>sadness
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway... ####<meld>sadness
No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan. ####<meld>neutral
Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. ####<meld>joy
Okay, okay, bye ####<meld>neutral
So what are they doing? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, something girlie. ####<meld>joy
Hey, youre early. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing with the lamp? ####<meld>surprise
Im just taking it to be re-wired. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week. ####<meld>disgust
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here. ####<meld>neutral
Youre disturbing my oboe practice. ####<meld>anger
You dont play the oboe! ####<meld>anger
I could play the oboe! ####<meld>anger
Ohhh! That is soo sweet! ####<meld>joy
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me. ####<meld>joy
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! ####<meld>anger
What is going on? ####<meld>surprise
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!! ####<meld>anger
Ross! ####<meld>surprise
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! ####<meld>anger
What do I have to do to get some service?! ####<meld>anger
Hi Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Ross? ####<meld>neutral

Hey its Mona! From the wedding. ####<meld>joy
Oh hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Wow! Uhhow are you? ####<meld>surprise
Im good except umm, you still owe me a dance. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film? ####<meld>joy
Oh youre serious. Sure! ####<meld>surprise
Great! Well umm ####<meld>joy
I think I might need one more cup of coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. ####<meld>sadness
Go! ####<meld>anger
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is? ####<meld>surprise
I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit. ####<meld>anger
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God Oh, hes in there right now? ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, lets rip! ####<meld>fear
Really? Are you sure? ####<meld>surprise
Oh Phoebe! ####<meld>joy
Okay, sorry. Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. ####<meld>joy
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and    I wanted to share it with you. ####<meld>joy
Oh, you're so wonderful. ####<meld>joy
It can’t be me, I’m standing right here. ####<meld>neutral
Wanna peek? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>disgust
Come on! ####<meld>surprise
We’re not peeking? ####<meld>sadness
Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Hello sir, you know Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler is fantastic!! ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow how people just click? ####<meld>joy
Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! ####<meld>joy
Did he tell you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart? ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know... ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through. ####<meld>joy
Isnt this great?! ####<meld>joy
Dont spoil it. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, sweetie! ####<meld>joy
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, huh. ####<meld>neutral
I?ve got some bad news. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>fear
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here. ####<meld>neutral
Come on sweetie! You?ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time? ####<meld>sadness
But work comes first!  Oh hey, but that?s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya? ####<meld>joy
Nooo, he?s leaving for a better job. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well that?s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye. ####<meld>joy

So, see ya on Saturday. ####<meld>neutral

Whazzup?? ####<meld>neutral
Seriously dude, 3 years ago. ####<meld>joy
Listen, can you do me a favor? ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna be out today. ####<meld>neutral
Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly? ####<meld>neutral
You don't trust him? ####<meld>surprise
I think the check in is that way. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh. ####<meld>neutral
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be! ####<meld>neutral
Well theres some people who do want to marry me. ####<meld>anger
There are? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Richard! ####<meld>anger
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?! ####<meld>surprise
Thats right. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler ####<meld>neutral
You just told me that he hates marriage! ####<meld>surprise
That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! ####<meld>anger
That-that hes against marriage and always will be! ####<meld>anger
You got ####<meld>neutral
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. ####<meld>fear
I knew. ####<meld>neutral
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. ####<meld>surprise
I did. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>sadness
Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? ####<meld>fear
Sometime? ####<meld>neutral
Maybe? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, maybe... ####<meld>joy
Okay... okay, maybe I will... ####<meld>joy
Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend. ####<meld>neutral
Well, youre amazing. ####<meld>joy
Oh no-no-no. ####<meld>neutral
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? ####<meld>surprise
Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I dont know. ####<meld>fear
Oh-no-no-no, you are! ####<meld>joy
You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that. ####<meld>joy
You mean with Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool. ####<meld>neutral
Or Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Could be Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No. No, Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Consider Casey. ####<meld>neutral
I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. ####<meld>joy
How bout I fix you two up? ####<meld>joy
What do you think? ####<meld>joy
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! ####<meld>joy
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end? ####<meld>neutral
Honey, whats the matter? ####<meld>neutral
I just saw Janice. ####<meld>neutral
Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know..... ####<meld>joy
Wow! This girl is good. ####<meld>surprise
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. ####<meld>anger
I like her. ####<meld>neutral
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time? ####<meld>neutral
Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people. ####<meld>neutral
Look at you. All jealous. ####<meld>anger
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more ####<meld>neutral
Say you'll stay beside me ####<meld>sadness
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done. ####<meld>anger
Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. ####<meld>neutral
I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, hello. ####<meld>neutral
I have a question. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. ####<meld>neutral
A beard and a moustache. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
No, ####<meld>neutral
What?! What else did he say? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. ####<meld>neutral
So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, no! There is ####<meld>anger
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I am a human doodle!! ####<meld>anger
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! ####<meld>neutral
And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna ####<meld>neutral
Okay, there was ####<meld>neutral
Come on! ####<meld>joy
Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies? ####<meld>joy
No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I dont ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!! ####<meld>surprise
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade? ####<meld>neutral
So?! ####<meld>disgust
Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up! ####<meld>disgust
Oh right, right. ####<meld>neutral
I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex? ####<meld>disgust
Well usually...yeah! ####<meld>surprise
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. ####<meld>neutral
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. ####<meld>neutral
Im such a jerk. ####<meld>sadness
Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it. ####<meld>neutral
Hmmm... this is so nice. ####<meld>joy
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment. ####<meld>neutral
OK. ####<meld>neutral
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um.... ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh!!!! ####<meld>surprise
Yes, yes, that's right... ####<meld>neutral
Oh, look at the little cat! ####<meld>surprise
What?  Ow! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point. ####<meld>neutral
I didn't mean ####<meld>neutral
It's brilliant! ####<meld>joy
Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! ####<meld>joy
well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Sincerely. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help. ####<meld>joy
David, I'm pretending to ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! ####<meld>joy
Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half! ####<meld>anger
We are switching at the next rest stop and ####<meld>anger
All right. All right. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice. ####<meld>anger
Really? I dont ####<meld>surprise
Sing!! ####<meld>anger
Morning! ####<meld>joy
Everything was delicious! ####<meld>joy
Thank you! ####<meld>joy
It was. The duck in particular was superb. ####<meld>joy
Thank you!    You haven't said anything... ####<meld>joy
Actually I do have one small complaint. ####<meld>neutral
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. ####<meld>neutral
The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer! ####<meld>sadness
What musician? ####<meld>surprise
We did? ####<meld>neutral
You owe me 20 bucks. ####<meld>joy
Thank you. Thank you so much! ####<meld>joy
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. ####<meld>neutral
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? ####<meld>surprise
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? ####<meld>anger
All right, I'm nine years old. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I hate this story. ####<meld>sadness
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. ####<meld>neutral
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my god. ####<meld>surprise
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, who's this little naked guy? ####<meld>surprise
That little naked guy would be me. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, look at the little thing. ####<meld>surprise
Who are those people? ####<meld>surprise
Got me. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? ####<meld>surprise
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? ####<meld>neutral
Looks like a fun gang. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! ####<meld>joy
So, whats this about? ####<meld>joy
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater. ####<meld>neutral
No.  This is my red sweater. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay. ####<meld>fear
Whats going on Rach? ####<meld>joy
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare? ####<meld>fear
Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called. ####<meld>joy
I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together. ####<meld>joy
Oh, its just not the right time. ####<meld>sadness
It is the right time. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Kay! ####<meld>joy

Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Can he handle the stick? ####<meld>neutral
Oh well ####<meld>neutral
I can handle the stick!! ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing? ####<meld>sadness
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass? ####<meld>sadness
Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true! ####<meld>surprise
Chandler Bing! ####<meld>surprise
Janice ####<meld>surprise
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything. ####<meld>joy
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen? ####<meld>surprise
Its you. This is yours. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years! ####<meld>joy
Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt? ####<meld>fear
Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here. ####<meld>neutral
I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? Really? No ones home? ####<meld>surprise
I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there ####<meld>neutral
Hey, what's up? ####<meld>neutral
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! ####<meld>anger
You had no relationship!! ####<meld>anger
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan! ####<meld>anger
Oh God, stop with the plan! ####<meld>anger
So what, so what you saw him with a girl? ####<meld>neutral
Who cares?! ####<meld>anger
That doesn't mean anything! ####<meld>anger
Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl. ####<meld>neutral
She was kinda stupid. ####<meld>neutral
You're right. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna go on the date. ####<meld>neutral
That is the new plan. ####<meld>neutral

Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people. ####<meld>neutral
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that? ####<meld>anger
I do it every year. ####<meld>neutral
You do that every year?? ####<meld>surprise
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!! ####<meld>anger
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us?? ####<meld>anger
Yeah... ####<meld>neutral
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant? ####<meld>anger
Yeah... ####<meld>neutral
OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory? ####<meld>anger
Who's this from? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's Ross's. ####<meld>neutral
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered. ####<meld>surprise
Remembered what? ####<meld>neutral
It was like months ago. ####<meld>surprise
We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe he remembered! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe he did this. ####<meld>surprise
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? ####<meld>neutral
What did you just say? ####<meld>surprise
F-hah.... flennin.... ####<meld>fear
Oh.... my God. ####<meld>surprise
I really like waking up with you. ####<meld>joy

That would be great! ####<meld>joy
We could have breakfast in bed ####<meld>joy
Wait, just a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Oh! Oh no. ####<meld>surprise
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from ####<meld>sadness
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  Youre Bonnie? ####<meld>surprise

Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you. ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that must be it. ####<meld>neutral
Well I hope you have fun tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks! You too. ####<meld>joy
I believe it. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I do. ####<meld>neutral
No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this. ####<meld>anger
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right. ####<meld>anger
I do not always have to beokay, okay. ####<meld>anger
Jurassic Park ####<meld>neutral
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night. ####<meld>fear
Maybe we should check the trash chute. ####<meld>neutral
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute. ####<meld>neutral
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
There he is! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!! ####<meld>anger
Just, y'know out. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there! ####<meld>anger
What were you doing? ####<meld>neutral
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while. ####<meld>neutral
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone. ####<meld>surprise
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want! ####<meld>anger
He hooked up!! Tell us about her! ####<meld>joy
Ross you left you scarf in Hey you guys. ####<meld>neutral

Im marrying her. ####<meld>joy
Well just see. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! ####<meld>anger
Hi Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! How you doin? ####<meld>neutral
He has the most amazing Porsche under there! ####<meld>joy
Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. ####<meld>neutral
Shes sleeping. ####<meld>neutral
Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? ####<meld>neutral
Well, the old lady died. ####<meld>sadness
And how do I know? ####<meld>neutral
Her dying wish was for one last kiss. ####<meld>neutral
But I dont care,  because you got the apartment. ####<meld>joy
Yes! ####<meld>joy
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here. ####<meld>disgust
Isnt that great? ####<meld>joy
Ezels!! ####<meld>disgust
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, its not your fault. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, thats great. ####<meld>joy
Oh, yeah! ####<meld>joy
Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign. ####<meld>neutral
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no. ####<meld>neutral
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up. ####<meld>joy
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, great. ####<meld>joy
You freak. ####<meld>disgust
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Um, coffee to go, please. ####<meld>neutral
Isabella Rosselini. ####<meld>neutral
Are you serious?  Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list. ####<meld>anger
Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, maybe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh, you lie. ####<meld>disgust
What you dont think Id go up to her? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. ####<meld>anger
You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, hold my crawler. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this? ####<meld>surprise
Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just sorry we dont got popcorn. ####<meld>joy
Okay, that's, that's enough. ####<meld>neutral
Won't you dance around with me. ####<meld>neutral
A-ha!!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies! ####<meld>joy
Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
It's me, Joey! ####<meld>joy
Do I know you? ####<meld>surprise
Joey! ####<meld>joy
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy. ####<meld>neutral
Okay thats fair. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Good! ####<meld>neutral
Pick one. ####<meld>neutral
Left!  Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Youre welcome. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! ####<meld>surprise
Joey!  We should just switch. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you. ####<meld>sadness
Oh thats all right! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, I ended up having a really good time. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness. ####<meld>joy
So what was it for anyway? ####<meld>neutral
I wanna say a disease. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh Professor Geller. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, to be 13 again. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets? ####<meld>neutral
No! He blew us off! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I know! ####<meld>surprise
I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now. ####<meld>anger
Can I tell you something? Me too. ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him ####<meld>anger
Ooooh! Freeze him out. ####<meld>joy
Thats right! ####<meld>joy
I like it! ####<meld>joy
Doorknob? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good. ####<meld>joy
Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. ####<meld>fear
So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet. ####<meld>sadness
Its-its too soon. ####<meld>fear
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks. ####<meld>surprise
No. I think you misunderstood what ####<meld>surprise
You are so adorable. ####<meld>joy
That! Lets talk about that. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
How do you feel? ####<meld>neutral
Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so I ####<meld>neutral
And protected them from a tornado? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
I know, the babies are asleep. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, what, what happened here?! ####<meld>surprise
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself! ####<meld>joy
But my apartment! ####<meld>surprise
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. ####<meld>neutral
Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! ####<meld>neutral
When will that be? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! ####<meld>anger
Hey Ross! The babys kicking! ####<meld>joy
What?! It is?! ####<meld>surprise
Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again. ####<meld>joy
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened? ####<meld>joy
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping ####<meld>joy
A dreamless sleep. ####<meld>neutral
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! ####<meld>joy
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! ####<meld>neutral
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
When are you coming home? ####<meld>neutral
What? Guys, I'm not. ####<meld>surprise
C'mon, this is us. ####<meld>neutral
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job- ####<meld>neutral
Waitressing? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. ####<meld>neutral
I'm.. ####<meld>neutral
I, um... ####<meld>neutral
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... ####<meld>neutral
I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies. ####<meld>sadness
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then? ####<meld>neutral
So, um, will you bring the truck? ####<meld>neutral
I'll even let you ring the bell. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, my god. ####<meld>surprise
See, there you go, the cleansing works! ####<meld>joy
They're nice guys. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, they're firemen guys. ####<meld>joy
Your son. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie. ####<meld>anger
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. ####<meld>neutral
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, ####<meld>surprise
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. ####<meld>anger
I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps. ####<meld>anger
No, you don't. ####<meld>neutral
All right, that's it. I want both of you out. ####<meld>anger
Why? ####<meld>surprise
He started it! ####<meld>anger
No, you started it. ####<meld>anger
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. ####<meld>anger
Now go! ####<meld>anger
Thanks a lot. ####<meld>anger
See what you did. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, listen... ####<meld>neutral
Out ####<meld>anger
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say? ####<meld>joy
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice. ####<meld>surprise
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. ####<meld>neutral
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times. ####<meld>neutral
You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali. ####<meld>neutral
Boutros Boutros Gali. ####<meld>neutral
He says he was too. ####<meld>neutral
Interesting. ####<meld>neutral
So I was wondering.... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit. ####<meld>joy
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. ####<meld>joy
So you're a chef? ####<meld>neutral
Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant. ####<meld>joy
Oh, really. ####<meld>surprise
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I was having a conversation. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other. ####<meld>anger
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation? ####<meld>anger
That would be great. Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera! ####<meld>disgust
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. ####<meld>neutral
When did that happen to you?! ####<meld>surprise
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera! ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it. ####<meld>joy
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants. ####<meld>anger
Here, I'll get it. ####<meld>neutral
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set. ####<meld>neutral
Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight. ####<meld>joy
Oh, great! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, bye!  Oh my God!! ####<meld>joy
That was unbelievable! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach. ####<meld>sadness
I don't believe they're brother and sister. ####<meld>surprise
They're brother and sister!!! ####<meld>surprise
Action! ####<meld>neutral
I found the picture! ####<meld>anger
What picture?! ####<meld>surprise
The picture of my wife! In your pack! ####<meld>anger
You went through my personal property? ####<meld>anger
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?! ####<meld>anger
Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years! ####<meld>anger
Cut! Wonderful! ####<meld>joy
Great scene yeah? ####<meld>joy
Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me. ####<meld>joy
Heres your call sheet for tomorrow. ####<meld>neutral
I know. ####<meld>neutral
So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged. ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, I should probably call them. ####<meld>neutral
I remember when we first got engaged. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened. ####<meld>joy
You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy! ####<meld>disgust
What a sweet story. ####<meld>neutral
Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party. ####<meld>disgust
What?! They wanted a scary story! ####<meld>surprise
Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
You tell her Jack, I cant do it. ####<meld>fear
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you? ####<meld>surprise
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house. ####<meld>neutral
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one, ####<meld>neutral
Did that! ####<meld>joy
Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh! ####<meld>surprise
Was it not pain-free? ####<meld>surprise
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax. ####<meld>disgust
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. ####<meld>anger
But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest. ####<meld>neutral
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!! ####<meld>surprise
Now umm, remember Im still learning. ####<meld>neutral
One, two, three, four! ####<meld>neutral
You know the song! Sing along! ####<meld>joy
So? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! Thats David! ####<meld>surprise
David who? ####<meld>neutral
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David! ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe? ####<meld>surprise
David!  What-what are you doing here? Arent you supposed to be in Russia? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, Im just, Im just in town for a conference. Umm, ####<meld>neutral
Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut? ####<meld>joy
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Santa's coming! ####<meld>joy
Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today. ####<meld>sadness
Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right? ####<meld>neutral
But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides ####<meld>neutral
Whatever. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Mon, back me up here. ####<meld>neutral
Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? ####<meld>neutral
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right? ####<meld>neutral
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. ####<meld>sadness
Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it. ####<meld>sadness
Yknow, hey I understand. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right? ####<meld>neutral
So its yknow, its uh, its cool. ####<meld>neutral
Ill see you tomorrow. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave. ####<meld>neutral
You did look like an idiot. ####<meld>joy
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. ####<meld>neutral
All right? ####<meld>neutral
Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" ####<meld>joy
And it came out, "Squatternut buash?" ####<meld>joy
Yeah that's the same. ####<meld>neutral
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving. ####<meld>sadness
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, for me anyway. ####<meld>sadness
And of course, the Indians. ####<meld>sadness
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story! ####<meld>anger
Hi, guys. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Phoebe. ####<meld>joy
Hi Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow. ####<meld>sadness
No we ####<meld>neutral
Hormones. ####<meld>neutral

Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though! ####<meld>joy
No leg-chewing for us sir. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, give it time. ####<meld>neutral
So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate. ####<meld>joy
How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night? ####<meld>neutral
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. ####<meld>joy
They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ill see you tomorrow! ####<meld>joy
Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow. ####<meld>neutral
I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. ####<meld>disgust
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding? ####<meld>disgust
No. ####<meld>neutral
Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party. ####<meld>disgust
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts ####<meld>disgust
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs ####<meld>neutral

I think I need a drink. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral

Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. ####<meld>neutral
And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape. ####<meld>neutral

Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you back, Ive got a Schemp in my office. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again. ####<meld>neutral
Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop. ####<meld>neutral
Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes? ####<meld>neutral
I dont have ten minutes!! ####<meld>anger
What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont! ####<meld>anger
Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week. ####<meld>sadness
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would you just go home, Ill talk to you later. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but wait... ####<meld>neutral
Good bye! ####<meld>neutral
Actually, thats our three hole punch. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah? When? ####<meld>surprise
I'll tell you what. ####<meld>neutral
When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one? ####<meld>neutral
Why won't I be married when I'm 40? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40? ####<meld>anger
No, no, no. ####<meld>neutral
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me? ####<meld>anger
Uh, uh. ####<meld>neutral
Well? ####<meld>surprise
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! ####<meld>surprise
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress. ####<meld>surprise
Did you go home and change? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by? ####<meld>neutral
No, I haven't seen him. ####<meld>neutral
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him? ####<meld>surprise
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, why? ####<meld>neutral
No reason. ####<meld>neutral
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas! ####<meld>joy
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, thats her. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow what would work? ####<meld>neutral
Stop making candy! ####<meld>anger
You mean they like you. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe. ####<meld>neutral
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? ####<meld>anger
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT! ####<meld>anger
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me! ####<meld>joy
Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then! ####<meld>joy
What? We could do it! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then. ####<meld>joy
I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go. ####<meld>neutral
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ####<meld>neutral
I cant do it! ####<meld>sadness
Now you do that, youre on TV. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards... ####<meld>neutral
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid" T-shirt anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I like it. Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day? ####<meld>anger
Oh, I embarrass you? ####<meld>surprise
How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you? ####<meld>neutral
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them? ####<meld>neutral
Theyre all tourists. ####<meld>neutral
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself. ####<meld>disgust
Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat. ####<meld>neutral
Good choice. ####<meld>anger
Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! ####<meld>anger
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. ####<meld>anger
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ####<meld>surprise
You don't even know me... ####<meld>anger
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this. ####<meld>sadness
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... ####<meld>sadness
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, heres what were gonna do. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. ####<meld>neutral
You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
All right, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
Haul ass!!! ####<meld>neutral
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. ####<meld>neutral
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer... ####<meld>neutral
...and live forever as a machine! ####<meld>joy
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? ####<meld>joy
You and I, we're interfacing. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I gotta go. ####<meld>fear
Ba dum bumb cheshhh! ####<meld>joy
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion. ####<meld>neutral
See? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind". ####<meld>fear
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I should go, too. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there. ####<meld>neutral
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. ####<meld>anger
And she was like "Oh, don't worry! ####<meld>sadness
I asked him. ####<meld>neutral
He's totally ok with seeing you!". ####<meld>anger
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him! ####<meld>joy
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him! ####<meld>anger
Exactly! ####<meld>neutral
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous! ####<meld>neutral
I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh, ####<meld>anger
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, that'll be great! ####<meld>joy
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together. ####<meld>disgust
That's not what we're gonna do! ####<meld>disgust
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'? ####<meld>disgust
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me. ####<meld>joy
Hello Skidmark. ####<meld>neutral
Its a nickname, Ill explain later. ####<meld>neutral
Its pretty clear. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight. ####<meld>neutral
Thats why you broke up with me? ####<meld>surprise
You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done! ####<meld>sadness
Ni-chou chi-ma! ####<meld>joy
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... ####<meld>surprise
Hi everyone. ####<meld>neutral
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey. ####<meld>neutral
What did, what did he say? ####<meld>fear
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. ####<meld>neutral
So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, great! ####<meld>joy
We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. ####<meld>joy
Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly. ####<meld>joy
All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?" ####<meld>joy
And did he? ####<meld>neutral
Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. ####<meld>joy
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. ####<meld>joy
Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I? ####<meld>sadness
You sound like a guy. ####<meld>disgust
No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." ####<meld>disgust
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! ####<meld>sadness
Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up! ####<meld>surprise
I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again. ####<meld>sadness
Youll have a last kiss. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you so much for coming back over. ####<meld>joy
Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable. ####<meld>sadness
I know Mona, just hear me out. ####<meld>neutral
First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. ####<meld>neutral
Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that. ####<meld>neutral
Focus. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are ####<meld>neutral
All right wheres that turkey! ####<meld>neutral
Joey! Those are my maternity pants! ####<meld>surprise
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants! ####<meld>joy
No. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Oh, would you look at that Monica? ####<meld>joy
I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad. ####<meld>joy
Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe! ####<meld>anger
Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning. ####<meld>joy
Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game! ####<meld>anger
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work. ####<meld>neutral
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! ####<meld>joy
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! ####<meld>sadness
Or Friday with no two pizzas! ####<meld>sadness
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over. ####<meld>sadness
No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey! ####<meld>joy
All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting? ####<meld>neutral
Thats right! ####<meld>joy
Cause Im a Tribbiani! ####<meld>joy
And this is what we do! ####<meld>neutral
We can eat! ####<meld>joy
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube. ####<meld>surprise
Look at this! ####<meld>joy
Oh! You have a window! ####<meld>surprise
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of... ####<meld>joy
Oh look! That guy's peeing! ####<meld>surprise
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too? ####<meld>anger
Okay. Lets use this brush. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. This stuff? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay-Dokey ####<meld>sadness
Where exactly is your zoo? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. ####<meld>neutral
Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
Does he, uh, fight with other animals? ####<meld>neutral
No-no, he's, he's very docile. ####<meld>neutral
Even if he were... cornered? ####<meld>neutral
Well I, I don't know. Why? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, how is he at handling small objects? ####<meld>neutral
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean... ####<meld>neutral
How about a hammer, or a small blade? ####<meld>neutral
Otherwise it's just cruel. ####<meld>neutral
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego. ####<meld>joy
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing... ####<meld>neutral
...He's in. ####<meld>neutral
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! ####<meld>joy
You're making a big mistake here. ####<meld>disgust
I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. ####<meld>neutral
My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. ####<meld>neutral
Really helped speed the process along! ####<meld>joy
Janice! ####<meld>surprise
You're not... gone? ####<meld>surprise
Sid is still in his room. ####<meld>neutral
I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. ####<meld>joy
So did you do it? ####<meld>surprise
Did you make your deposit? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over! ####<meld>joy
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results? ####<meld>fear
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok. ####<meld>joy
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, where's your purse? ####<meld>fear
No, no! Give it to me! ####<meld>anger
You can't have it. ####<meld>anger
Give it to me! ####<meld>anger
No ####<meld>anger
I'll go in there. ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah. ####<meld>anger
Phoebe come here ####<meld>neutral
Haha! ####<meld>joy
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing! ####<meld>anger
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial. ####<meld>disgust
I just had sex. ####<meld>neutral
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me? ####<meld>surprise
Well, you never told me how old you were. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking? ####<meld>disgust
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'... ####<meld>joy
Don't say it. ####<meld>fear
...in love with you. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well,fall out of it. ####<meld>anger
You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. ####<meld>anger
Oh god, oh god. ####<meld>joy
I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. ####<meld>disgust
I'm Joan Collins. ####<meld>disgust
Who? ####<meld>neutral
Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room! ####<meld>sadness
Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here? ####<meld>neutral
You. Like you havent done enough. ####<meld>anger
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. ####<meld>neutral
I mean I wish I were a seahorse. ####<meld>neutral
Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies. ####<meld>neutral
And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea. ####<meld>anger
God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life! ####<meld>joy
Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end ####<meld>neutral
Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. ####<meld>neutral
Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea? ####<meld>sadness
Oh God, get out! ####<meld>anger
Get out!! ####<meld>anger
Get out!! ####<meld>anger
Get out! ####<meld>anger
Lets. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now? ####<meld>fear
I cant watch! ####<meld>fear
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Seriously, how can you watch this? ####<meld>sadness
Arent you scared? ####<meld>fear
Terrified. ####<meld>fear
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are! ####<meld>joy
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I ####<meld>neutral
Fine! Maybe I will too! ####<meld>joy
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away. ####<meld>fear
You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away! ####<meld>fear
MY SANDWICH?!!! ####<meld>anger
MY SANDWICH!!!!!! ####<meld>anger
Whats the matter, Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. ####<meld>sadness
Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is. ####<meld>sadness
She knows, and she wont tell me. ####<meld>sadness
Aww Pheebs, that sucks! ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet. ####<meld>sadness
Where ya going? ####<meld>neutral
Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering. ####<meld>fear
Well, are any of those people here?! ####<meld>anger
Oh my God, so do I! ####<meld>surprise
I knew it, wow!! ####<meld>surprise
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, so cute. ####<meld>joy
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you. ####<meld>anger
I know. Im mad at me too. ####<meld>anger
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Me too! ####<meld>surprise
All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, you can do this. ####<meld>neutral
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. ####<meld>neutral
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. ####<meld>neutral
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice. ####<meld>sadness
All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it. ####<meld>anger
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out! ####<meld>surprise
Really?  My God, hes really cute. ####<meld>surprise
Go for it. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, Im engaged! ####<meld>surprise
Im just saying, get his number just in case. ####<meld>neutral
But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill. ####<meld>neutral
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged. ####<meld>joy
Well you should be embarrassed. ####<meld>disgust
I did, but that was really fun. ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler. I sensed it was you. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Unagi. Im always aware. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel? ####<meld>joy
Whats up? ####<meld>neutral
I cant figure out what to make Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes. ####<meld>anger
Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade? ####<meld>fear
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Shed-shed love this. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8. ####<meld>neutral
I made it in the sixth grade. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon. ####<meld>neutral
But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. ####<meld>joy
Wait a minute, I cant give this to her. ####<meld>neutral
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up! ####<meld>anger
He might still show up. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours. ####<meld>anger
Is that all? ####<meld>neutral
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding? ####<meld>sadness
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. ####<meld>neutral
Um, its going to be a small ceremony. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, tiny! ####<meld>surprise
Were not even sure why were having it. ####<meld>neutral
Its actually going to be just family. ####<meld>neutral
Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing ####<meld>surprise
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements. ####<meld>joy
Oh great! What, you brought Joey? ####<meld>joy
Well, I brought the next best thing. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! ####<meld>joy
You're so sweet! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, you're so sweet! ####<meld>joy
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me. ####<meld>surprise
Huh. ####<meld>neutral
Well? Aren't you gonna do something? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh. ####<meld>neutral
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna? ####<meld>anger
Nah. ####<meld>neutral
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something! ####<meld>fear
Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?! ####<meld>anger
No! ####<meld>anger
Do you like car games? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yknow the license plate game? ####<meld>neutral
I ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, Ill play! Ill play! ####<meld>joy
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! ####<meld>anger
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? ####<meld>neutral
I cant figure this out! ####<meld>anger
Its so hard! ####<meld>sadness
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah! ####<meld>sadness
Paper cut! ####<meld>sadness
Now, have you told anyone else? ####<meld>neutral
No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out. ####<meld>neutral
You told me. ####<meld>surprise
Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures. ####<meld>anger
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet. ####<meld>surprise
Me too. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? ####<meld>joy
Oh all right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place. ####<meld>neutral
How rude. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite? ####<meld>surprise
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
The ring is gone! ####<meld>surprise
Ugh. ####<meld>disgust
Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!! ####<meld>neutral
You lost the ring! ####<meld>joy
Youre the worst best man ever! ####<meld>anger
Dude, this isnt funny! ####<meld>anger
What am I gonna do?! ####<meld>fear
I go to bed last night, everythings cool! ####<meld>joy
I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone! ####<meld>fear
You slept with the stripper? ####<meld>surprise
Of course!! ####<meld>fear
What difference does that make?! ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference! ####<meld>anger
Joey, do you have a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Dude, what am I gonna ####<meld>fear
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. ####<meld>anger
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem! ####<meld>fear
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have ####<meld>neutral
What-what is it, what is it? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone. ####<meld>surprise
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know! ####<meld>fear
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable! ####<meld>anger
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone! ####<meld>disgust
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they? ####<meld>surprise
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! ####<meld>disgust
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone ####<meld>fear
I'm not listening to you! ####<meld>anger
Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it! ####<meld>joy
Hey, come on now! ####<meld>anger
All right, what are we havin? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation. ####<meld>neutral
Ill take those to go.  For the kids. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there? ####<meld>neutral
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said. ####<meld>anger
But believe me, thats not gonna happen today. ####<meld>neutral
Understood. So, whatd you say back then? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I said that I ####<meld>neutral
Ha! ####<meld>neutral
So you like the drums! ####<meld>joy
That's, that's great! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. ####<meld>neutral
All right, okay, well, apparently not! ####<meld>sadness
So, yay! ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four... ####<meld>neutral
Tequila!! ####<meld>joy
That's fun. ####<meld>joy
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. ####<meld>sadness
Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson. ####<meld>anger
Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it. ####<meld>fear
Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed. ####<meld>anger
All right thats it, school is in session! ####<meld>neutral
My God! Is this a gym card? ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times. ####<meld>neutral
So why dont you quit? ####<meld>neutral
You dont think Ive tried? You think I ####<meld>joy
Who is Maria? ####<meld>neutral
Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat. ####<meld>joy
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
So youre strong enough to face her on your own? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, youll have to come. ####<meld>fear
Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that. ####<meld>neutral
Exactly! Because it's in the past! ####<meld>anger
Anybody gonna eat that? ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear! ####<meld>surprise
I know. They were mine. ####<meld>neutral
Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird! ####<meld>disgust
No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on. ####<meld>neutral
Thats weird! ####<meld>disgust
Im wearing his briefs right now. ####<meld>neutral
Thatskinda hot. ####<meld>surprise
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I wouldnt know about that. ####<meld>neutral
And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin. ####<meld>joy
Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture! ####<meld>disgust
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys. ####<meld>disgust
Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear! ####<meld>neutral
I dont think you could ever do that. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! I ####<meld>neutral
Okay, whatever. ####<meld>disgust
Lusts of the flesh. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know.  A cowboy theme? ####<meld>neutral
Hey uh, is it okay to come in? ####<meld>neutral
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it! ####<meld>joy
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast? ####<meld>neutral
It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen. ####<meld>neutral
Yowza ####<meld>anger
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth. ####<meld>neutral
Dear Lord. ####<meld>surprise
I’m sorry honey, what were you saying? ####<meld>neutral
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that… ####<meld>neutral
Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth? ####<meld>neutral
She looks scared. ####<meld>neutral
Doesn’t she  look scared? ####<meld>neutral
Y’know, I don’t really know her. ####<meld>neutral
Can you see my nipples through this shirt? ####<meld>neutral
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there. ####<meld>neutral
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo." ####<meld>neutral
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... ####<meld>sadness
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. ####<meld>anger
The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a... ####<meld>anger
Pathetic mess? ####<meld>neutral
I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. ####<meld>neutral
I'm thinkin', cha-ching! ####<meld>joy
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. ####<meld>neutral
You're doin' this. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. She said yes. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh? ####<meld>joy
"Happy birthday to you!" ####<meld>joy
Youre paying for that. ####<meld>neutral
What? No-no its her birthday! ####<meld>surprise
Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today! ####<meld>surprise
But it really ####<meld>neutral
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins. ####<meld>neutral
Damnit! ####<meld>anger
Rach? Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Did you tell your sister to ask me out? ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow! ####<meld>surprise
I mean, wow! ####<meld>surprise
I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never! ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!" ####<meld>joy
Oh so-so not really never. ####<meld>neutral
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. ####<meld>neutral
I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-ho, and mine! ####<meld>joy
No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me. ####<meld>fear
WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself? ####<meld>sadness
Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist! ####<meld>sadness
Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
I-Im sorry? ####<meld>sadness
No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist! ####<meld>sadness
Oh yeah? ####<meld>sadness
I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. ####<meld>neutral
Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk. ####<meld>sadness
Hang-hang on. ####<meld>neutral
Hey everybody! ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Im gonna kill myself! ####<meld>sadness
I got nothing. ####<meld>neutral
Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! ####<meld>surprise
I didnt know he could get me fired! ####<meld>surprise
What am I going to do? ####<meld>fear
Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here. ####<meld>fear
No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass! ####<meld>neutral
Thats not a bad idea. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. ####<meld>neutral
Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. ####<meld>joy
So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, you wish. ####<meld>neutral
"You wish." ####<meld>joy
Why are you yelling? ####<meld>joy
Whoa, that ####<meld>neutral
Whoa-whoa, what is it? ####<meld>surprise
Well Its a date. ####<meld>neutral
A date?! ####<meld>surprise
No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend! ####<meld>surprise
Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this. ####<meld>sadness
No, Im gonna!! ####<meld>anger
Thats right! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl! ####<meld>anger
Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! ####<meld>anger
And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing! ####<meld>anger
ThatIts not the same thing! This is ####<meld>anger
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too! ####<meld>anger

Oh yeah, Id love that. ####<meld>joy
Oh, great! Me too. ####<meld>joy
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. ####<meld>neutral
And why do you care so much? ####<meld>neutral
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy! ####<meld>joy
You had fantasies about Emily? ####<meld>sadness
No! Yknow, ####<meld>neutral
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid? ####<meld>neutral

Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed. ####<meld>neutral
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. ####<meld>joy

Okay to come in? ####<meld>neutral

Yeah I know, guess who beeped him? ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Im the ruptured spleen. ####<meld>sadness
Why would you do that? ####<meld>joy
Because you shouldnt be with him.  You should be with me. ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise
When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! ####<meld>sadness
Look, things like last night they dont just happen. ####<meld>neutral
Or at least not to me. ####<meld>neutral
Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! ####<meld>surprise
I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor" ####<meld>sadness
There was just one woman, wasnt there? ####<meld>neutral
No, there were two. ####<meld>neutral
Including me? ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy

Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker? ####<meld>disgust
Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had. ####<meld>surprise
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid. ####<meld>sadness
Im your mother. ####<meld>neutral
Ehh? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler... ####<meld>neutral
Hi there. ####<meld>neutral
...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really know what happened with that either. ####<meld>neutral
And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. ####<meld>neutral
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either... ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment? ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah, I lied before. ####<meld>sadness

HowHow small are your feet? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Im-Im saving this for my friend Ross. ####<meld>neutral
You mean Dr. Geller? ####<meld>neutral
Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, he wont sit here. ####<meld>neutral
Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize. ####<meld>sadness
Oh yeah man.  Joey. ####<meld>neutral

A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished. ####<meld>neutral
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet. ####<meld>joy
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me. ####<meld>neutral
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum? ####<meld>neutral

No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. ####<meld>anger
It-it-its no big deal, all right, Im-Im cool. ####<meld>fear
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes! ####<meld>sadness
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck. ####<meld>disgust
Oh God! ####<meld>sadness
So, how many have you sold so far? ####<meld>neutral
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God, how did you do that? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! ####<meld>joy
Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. ####<meld>joy
I am selling cookies by the case. ####<meld>joy
They call me: 'Cookie Dude!' ####<meld>joy
Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers..... ####<meld>neutral

The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them? ####<meld>surprise
No you didnt. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. ####<meld>neutral
And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? ####<meld>neutral
Why not a Yugoslavian?" ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, then you did that. ####<meld>neutral
So you dont have the cameras?! ####<meld>surprise
No. Sorry man. ####<meld>sadness
So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak! ####<meld>surprise
Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel. Ill-Ill help you look for them. ####<meld>neutral
Great. ####<meld>anger

This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is notthats-thats not what it is. ####<meld>joy
See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. ####<meld>neutral
Its-its, theyre-theyre wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at ####<meld>neutral
Maybe in L.A? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! ####<meld>joy
There you go. ####<meld>neutral
So, have you kids eaten yet? ####<meld>neutral
Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next. ####<meld>neutral

Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin around the house. ####<meld>neutral
So We go eat. ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
Youll wear that. Well be eating, and of course, youll be wearing that. ####<meld>neutral
Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller! ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Enough! ####<meld>anger
Lean lean lean ####<meld>joy
Let me see that. ####<meld>neutral
This one right here. ####<meld>neutral
Triskaidekaphobia. ####<meld>neutral
The fear of ####<meld>neutral

Its possible, they have really sharp edges. ####<meld>neutral
All right Chandler, youre up. ####<meld>neutral
Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn? ####<meld>joy
This game makes no sense! ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing. ####<meld>joy
Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here. ####<meld>neutral
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card. ####<meld>neutral
Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care. ####<meld>anger
You-you must choose Mr. Bing. ####<meld>neutral
Either, it makes no difference. ####<meld>neutral
Choose, you jackass! ####<meld>anger
Ill take a card. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points! ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
This game is kinda fun. ####<meld>joy
You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you ####<meld>neutral
I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other. ####<meld>neutral
Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me! ####<meld>surprise
Very funny Ross! ####<meld>joy

"Oh, my, god." ####<meld>surprise
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!" ####<meld>joy
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise. ####<meld>neutral
We won. We won! ####<meld>joy
Mr. Heckles. ####<meld>neutral
How did this happen? ####<meld>neutral
He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand. ####<meld>neutral
That's terrible. ####<meld>anger
I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me. ####<meld>neutral
Sure, you coulda. You never know. ####<meld>neutral
You never know. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Where's Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, he needed some time to grieve. ####<meld>neutral
I'm free! I'm free! ####<meld>joy
That oughta do it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning. ####<meld>sadness
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning? ####<meld>surprise
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale. ####<meld>neutral
I didn't know there were docks. ####<meld>surprise
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, is it broken? ####<meld>sadness
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. ####<meld>joy
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed? ####<meld>neutral
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out. ####<meld>sadness
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket. ####<meld>anger
What is this? Fruit? ####<meld>surprise
Monica's making jam. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place? ####<meld>joy
Because the kids need new shoes. ####<meld>neutral
I'm going into business people. ####<meld>neutral
I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. ####<meld>neutral
I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. ####<meld>anger
What's the opposite of man? ####<meld>neutral
Jam. ####<meld>neutral
Oh Joey don't! ####<meld>fear
It's way to hot. ####<meld>anger
This will just be my batch. ####<meld>neutral
Why? Do you think hes still mad at us? ####<meld>surprise
Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles. ####<meld>neutral
What? Mine arent tinted. ####<meld>surprise
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? ####<meld>neutral
I will have one. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im not gonna have one. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, its just my tooth. ####<meld>sadness
All right Ill have one. ####<meld>neutral
So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one. ####<meld>neutral
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him. ####<meld>fear
See that is the problem with invisible dentists. ####<meld>neutral
Why? Why cant you go to him? ####<meld>surprise
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies. ####<meld>anger
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob. ####<meld>neutral
And all these people actually died? ####<meld>surprise
Yes, while I was in the chair! ####<meld>sadness
Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives! ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. ####<meld>neutral
Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence. ####<meld>neutral
Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead. ####<meld>sadness
Hello? ####<meld>surprise
Ross. ####<meld>neutral
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things. ####<meld>sadness
No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called. ####<meld>joy
Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else. ####<meld>joy
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America? ####<meld>sadness
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. ####<meld>sadness
So, let's go. ####<meld>neutral
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now. ####<meld>neutral
You know, the guys are probably having a great time. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ive got three of my five. ####<meld>neutral
Three of your five, what? ####<meld>neutral
Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left. ####<meld>neutral
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely.... ####<meld>joy
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving. ####<meld>surprise
Susan Sarandon. ####<meld>neutral
Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first. ####<meld>disgust
And!! Isabella Rosselini. ####<meld>joy
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around. ####<meld>joy
So? ####<meld>neutral
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out? ####<meld>sadness
Yknow what I think it is? ####<meld>neutral
I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! ####<meld>sadness
Twenty-one hours, youre a hero. ####<meld>neutral
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out. ####<meld>sadness
Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom. ####<meld>neutral
My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker! ####<meld>surprise
Are they here yet? ####<meld>neutral
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok? ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
May I see your boarding pass? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass. ####<meld>neutral
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. ####<meld>neutral
He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just... ####<meld>sadness
No no no! Federal regulations! ####<meld>anger

Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide between the two of them. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. ####<meld>neutral
But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes ####<meld>neutral
If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
She lives so close. ####<meld>neutral
And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny. ####<meld>neutral
On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist. ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant? ####<meld>joy
Damn! ####<meld>joy
Oh heres a whole bunch. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." ####<meld>neutral
Then shell have to come back here and live all alone. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant.  So I guess she wont be totally alone. ####<meld>surprise
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger. ####<meld>sadness
It really wasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think youll really enjoy. ####<meld>anger
Now, this is just a loan. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Im gonna, Im gonna want him back. ####<meld>neutral
So  Im gonna go now. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant! ####<meld>sadness
All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?! ####<meld>sadness
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. ####<meld>neutral
All right ladies, heres what were gonna do. ####<meld>neutral
I-I wanna be with her,  I like her. ####<meld>anger
Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts. ####<meld>joy
Wait, now, what am I doing again? ####<meld>surprise
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment! ####<meld>anger
Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no, that not Joshua. ####<meld>anger
What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy. ####<meld>surprise
So anyway, Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay,  but the rest of us have a ####<meld>sadness
How do I look? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, now, remember, no trading. ####<meld>neutral
You get the pretty one, I get the mess. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice. ####<meld>joy
...And what did you bring? ####<meld>neutral
She's checking the coats. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. ####<meld>neutral
Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. ####<meld>neutral
Janice? ####<meld>surprise
Oh.... my.... God. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, it's Janice. ####<meld>neutral
Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please? ####<meld>anger
Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?! ####<meld>sadness
Hey Rach! ####<meld>anger
What was that?! ####<meld>surprise
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie? ####<meld>neutral
I havent seen it yet! ####<meld>neutral
Well then youd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! ####<meld>surprise
No ####<meld>anger
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Uh, okay, Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?! ####<meld>anger
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, all of us! All day! ####<meld>joy
That sucks! ####<meld>disgust
That's not a trip! ####<meld>surprise
I just came from the park! ####<meld>anger
What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? ####<meld>anger
"Well, it's right by my house, all right!" ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. ####<meld>anger
Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! ####<meld>surprise
Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it! ####<meld>anger
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group. ####<meld>sadness
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth. ####<meld>disgust
Makes me wanna puke! ####<meld>disgust
Is she in there? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her. ####<meld>neutral
Oh its all right. ####<meld>neutral
Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing. ####<meld>sadness
Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different. ####<meld>sadness
This is hard. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah I know. ####<meld>neutral
On the other hand in um, in about seven months youre gonna have something that youre gonna love more than any guy youve ever gone out with. ####<meld>neutral
Just wait. ####<meld>neutral
Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. ####<meld>joy
You have no idea. ####<meld>joy
Thanks sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, I think Im gonna go home and eat ten candy bars. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, I thought I cheered you up. ####<meld>neutral
Oh you did, there are twenty in here. ####<meld>neutral
Right. Good night. ####<meld>neutral
Good night. ####<meld>neutral
Hi ####<meld>neutral
Hi!  Hey mom. ####<meld>joy
This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom? ####<meld>joy
Jack? ####<meld>surprise
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? ####<meld>surprise
Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question ####<meld>neutral
Congratulations you two! ####<meld>joy
Thank youwere so excited ####<meld>joy
And also, congratulations on your wedding. ####<meld>joy
WhaWhat? ####<meld>surprise
Look at this clown! ####<meld>joy
Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. ####<meld>disgust
Get out of the way jackass! ####<meld>anger
Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway? ####<meld>disgust
That ####<meld>neutral
What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>anger
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! ####<meld>surprise
Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?! ####<meld>neutral
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Really?! Well, its just like everyone elses apartment. Its got rooms, walls, and ceilings. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Ah well, this is the living room. ####<meld>neutral
All right. This is the kitchen. ####<meld>neutral
The bedroom. Well its pretty much your typical...  bedroom. ####<meld>neutral
Were still on this side of the door. ####<meld>neutral
Ha-ha ####<meld>joy
Yeah, but I didnt get to see it. ####<meld>sadness
Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening. ####<meld>neutral
So um, who was she? ####<meld>joy
Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today. ####<meld>neutral
Did you like her? And Im just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you seem fine. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont think this, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird. ####<meld>disgust
Yeah, no, Ill get one of the other girls to do it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, this will be so much fun! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Are you excited? ####<meld>joy
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine. ####<meld>neutral
All I have is, is oregano and a ####<meld>neutral
Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man. ####<meld>joy
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place. ####<meld>neutral
Can we just start throwing things in? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah. ####<meld>neutral
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked. ####<meld>neutral
Hey he's wearing a sweater. ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Eww! ####<meld>disgust
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure... ####<meld>neutral
Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? ####<meld>neutral
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, its okay. ####<meld>neutral
No, its still wet. ####<meld>joy
Let me get it out before it sets. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, I have something you can wear. ####<meld>neutral
Here. ####<meld>neutral
Oh umm, I-I dont know if I want to wear a womans shirt. ####<meld>sadness
No-no thats a mans shirt. ####<meld>neutral
Its awfully pink. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, it's perfect! ####<meld>joy
How about you? ####<meld>neutral
It's a kitchen slash bathroom. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application. ####<meld>neutral
We are bad people. ####<meld>disgust
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen? ####<meld>surprise
Lets get the show on it! ####<meld>joy
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close. ####<meld>neutral
Closer than here? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, lets skedaddle. ####<meld>neutral
Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, your highness. ####<meld>neutral
Um, Rachel Im really sorry.  Thats okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?! ####<meld>surprise
So how did you know I was even here? ####<meld>surprise
Your mom called me. So is this her? ####<meld>neutral
No, this is a loaner. ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. ####<meld>neutral
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, they're not so bad. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im ####<meld>neutral
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour. ####<meld>surprise
Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely. ####<meld>sadness
All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong. ####<meld>fear
I just called a friend of mine. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
I think I may be able to book ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
What is it sweetie? ####<meld>joy
Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry daddy. ####<meld>sadness
I dont believe this!! ####<meld>neutral
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please. ####<meld>fear
Stay calm?!! ####<meld>anger
How do you expect me to stay calm?! ####<meld>anger
This is unacceptable Rachel! ####<meld>anger
And I wanna know why?!! ####<meld>anger
Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?! ####<meld>anger
Thats it! ####<meld>anger
Is that it? ####<meld>anger
Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods. ####<meld>sadness
So, youre like a zillionaire? ####<meld>surprise
And youre our age. Youre our age. ####<meld>surprise
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself. ####<meld>neutral
What like Pete Dakota? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago. ####<meld>neutral
Thats not a state Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is? ####<meld>neutral
I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Youre our age! ####<meld>surprise
So ah, we on for tomorrow? ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Now get out of here you!! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him! ####<meld>anger
Look, is there something wrong with me? ####<meld>sadness
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future? ####<meld>sadness
Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on! ####<meld>sadness
I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me? ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im gonna go get Frank. ####<meld>neutral
So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember? ####<meld>neutral
And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? ####<meld>neutral
You know what else Im not gonna miss? ####<meld>anger
"Im Monica. ####<meld>anger
I wash the toilet 17 times a day. ####<meld>anger
Even if people are on it!" ####<meld>anger
"Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!" ####<meld>anger
"Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!" ####<meld>anger
Hey! I call her! ####<meld>joy
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!" ####<meld>anger
"Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend! ####<meld>anger
So I guess Ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!" ####<meld>anger
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. ####<meld>neutral
Item J437-A, color: winterberry. ####<meld>neutral
Hi umm, listen come here, come in. ####<meld>neutral
Im so-so sorry about yesterday. ####<meld>sadness
I-Im really sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Its just that I ####<meld>joy
Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there. ####<meld>neutral
You do? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, you still have feelings for me. ####<meld>sadness
And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. ####<meld>joy
And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant. ####<meld>sadness
Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be. ####<meld>sadness
Oh God youre right. ####<meld>joy
Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you? ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>neutral
Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it. ####<meld>neutral
Gimme this. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist. ####<meld>neutral
Brides magazines? ####<meld>surprise
Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing. ####<meld>sadness
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. ####<meld>surprise
I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant. ####<meld>joy
Right? ####<meld>joy
I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
I know.  I need more pie. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests? ####<meld>neutral
You didnt break up with that fireman? ####<meld>surprise
No, that was my way of telling you. ####<meld>neutral
Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. ####<meld>neutral
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal. ####<meld>neutral
So then, are you going to dump Jason? ####<meld>neutral
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know? ####<meld>neutral
So Its really just about the math. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, look! Enough is enough! ####<meld>anger
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him! ####<meld>joy
Monica, that was also true an ####<meld>neutral
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours! ####<meld>anger
You knew this about me when you married me! ####<meld>neutral
You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. ####<meld>neutral
Well, this is my sickness! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah me too, all night. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! How come we didnt cross paths? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper. ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there! ####<meld>surprise
Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone. ####<meld>neutral
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy! ####<meld>disgust
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! ####<meld>anger
So. ####<meld>neutral
So. ####<meld>neutral
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you know, we've never really talked. ####<meld>neutral
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right? ####<meld>neutral
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. ####<meld>fear
Really? Me? ####<meld>surprise
Oh my god, are you kidding? ####<meld>surprise
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't. ####<meld>anger
Well, you're not totally paranoid. ####<meld>neutral
Oy. ####<meld>joy
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right. ####<meld>sadness
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it. ####<meld>joy
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later. ####<meld>neutral
All right, Julie. ####<meld>neutral
Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Bye.  What a manipulative bitch. ####<meld>disgust
Chandler, I found the perfect ring. ####<meld>joy
Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over! ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail! ####<meld>sadness
They put you in jail? ####<meld>surprise
The little jail between the doors! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring! ####<meld>anger
I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring. ####<meld>anger
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps. ####<meld>sadness
Maybe it was the guy. ####<meld>neutral
It was the ring! ####<meld>anger
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy? ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her. ####<meld>neutral
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. ####<meld>anger
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.. ####<meld>surprise
We can, we can go to Aruba! ####<meld>joy
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. ####<meld>sadness
You would've liked it. ####<meld>sadness
I had a bra. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Dr. Farber. ####<meld>neutral
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid. ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! What does ####<meld>surprise
Oh that's an eye removal machine. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I'm outta here! ####<meld>anger
I'm kidding! I'm kidding! ####<meld>joy
So were done then! ####<meld>anger
Almost! But first, we gotta start. ####<meld>neutral
This is a glaucoma test. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Sit down. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
A small puff of air, now come on! ####<meld>anger
Sure, now Im scared. ####<meld>fear
No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but I dont wanna die! ####<meld>fear
No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys! ####<meld>joy
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step. ####<meld>neutral
Youre building a post office? ####<meld>surprise
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  My word! Those are snug. ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes. ####<meld>neutral
Power saw kinda got away from me there. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again! ####<meld>anger
So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem? ####<meld>neutral
I cant seem to say goodbye. ####<meld>sadness
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more? ####<meld>surprise
Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?! ####<meld>anger
It was cheesecake. ####<meld>neutral
It was fine. ####<meld>neutral
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow! ####<meld>surprise
My whole mouth just filled with saliva! ####<meld>joy
Yknow what? Forget it! ####<meld>anger
Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted. ####<meld>neutral
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch? ####<meld>neutral
Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. ####<meld>neutral
This ones from me. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh! ####<meld>surprise
It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun. ####<meld>neutral
A scooter! ####<meld>surprise
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list. ####<meld>neutral
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys? ####<meld>neutral
For my last birthday you gave me a ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Happy birthday Grandma! ####<meld>joy
Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it. ####<meld>neutral
All our love Monica and Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Thats funny, yeah! ####<meld>joy
No-no-no-no! That was the joke! ####<meld>surprise
No, I know! I get it! Its funny! ####<meld>joy
No, because youre not a grandmother! ####<meld>sadness
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things. ####<meld>sadness
Thats why its so funny. ####<meld>neutral
All you had to do was buy the card! ####<meld>anger
Hey, Joey. What's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. ####<meld>neutral
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?! ####<meld>disgust
Sorry. Wrong boobies. ####<meld>sadness
Hello, Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! ...Hello, dear. ####<meld>surprise
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? ####<meld>surprise

Really? ####<meld>surprise
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. ####<meld>disgust
Hey, buddy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that's attractive. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. ####<meld>joy
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? ####<meld>disgust
Oh, ah- the kid has it. ####<meld>neutral
The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck. ####<meld>anger
You gotta do it, man. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck. ####<meld>anger

Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! ####<meld>anger

Oh, look, wish me luck! ####<meld>joy
What for? ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna go get one of those  job things. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right? ####<meld>neutral
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate! ####<meld>anger
What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green! ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Im so glad you could make it. ####<meld>joy
Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it. ####<meld>joy
Try. Theres my little girl. ####<meld>joy
Shes still mad. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay. ####<meld>neutral
Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself. ####<meld>joy
Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross? ####<meld>neutral
No, I dont think well be doing that. ####<meld>disgust
Were not gonna do that. ####<meld>disgust
Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare. ####<meld>neutral
Am I interrupting? ####<meld>neutral
Uh yes! Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Oh. Oh wait no. ####<meld>neutral
Later. ####<meld>neutral
Oh uh, Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father! ####<meld>fear
Try feeding her again. ####<meld>neutral
I already fed her. ####<meld>neutral
I know, that’s why I said again! ####<meld>anger
Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants. ####<meld>fear
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh. ####<meld>joy
Oh Monica, we are so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
For what? ####<meld>joy
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower. ####<meld>sadness
And then for forgetting to invite you to it. ####<meld>neutral
You al-you already had it? ####<meld>surprise
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either. ####<meld>sadness
We ruined everything. ####<meld>sadness
Ugh ####<meld>sadness
Well no, wait a minute, thats not true! ####<meld>sadness
No, what did, that was really sweet. ####<meld>joy
And it kinda works out for the best. ####<meld>joy
What do you, what do you mean? ####<meld>surprise
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! ####<meld>joy
I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like! ####<meld>joy
Surprise ####<meld>sadness
Surprise ####<meld>joy
Monica. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!! ####<meld>anger
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. ####<meld>neutral
Not you guys. ####<meld>neutral
You got it going on! ####<meld>joy
So, what are we gonna do today? ####<meld>neutral
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play! ####<meld>surprise
I don't think so! ####<meld>joy
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying! ####<meld>neutral
I'm not always that bad! ####<meld>neutral
Oh, ####<meld>neutral
I punched you...? ####<meld>surprise
And...? ####<meld>surprise
... Phoebe...? ####<meld>surprise
... and...? ####<meld>neutral
I clunked your heads together! ####<meld>neutral
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire. ####<meld>sadness
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room. ####<meld>neutral
All right. Did everyone get out okay? ####<meld>fear
Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh. What is this? ####<meld>surprise
No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!! ####<meld>fear
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets! ####<meld>sadness
Hey! How long until Petes fight? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. ####<meld>neutral
Hot dog? ####<meld>neutral
Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you. ####<meld>fear
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie? ####<meld>neutral
I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, thats too bad! ####<meld>sadness
No, I-Im saying I liked her. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea. ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again. ####<meld>joy
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else? ####<meld>disgust
Hey! Which ones my turkey burger? ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, the fights starting! ####<meld>joy
Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today? ####<meld>neutral
Nine times! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I had to put on lotion! ####<meld>neutral
But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free. ####<meld>neutral
Fights over! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before. ####<meld>surprise
Hi guys! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
What are you up too? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, Big Brother. ####<meld>neutral
Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? ####<meld>neutral
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world! ####<meld>anger
Eh ####<meld>neutral
Okay well thats good to know. ####<meld>sadness
The Mr. Bowmonts here!!! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business. ####<meld>joy
Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie. ####<meld>neutral
My friends name is Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Apparently Howies editing now. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. ####<meld>anger
Can you believe that?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie. ####<meld>disgust
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first! ####<meld>disgust
The nerve huh? ####<meld>disgust
Yeah! ####<meld>disgust
Refill? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! How you doing? ####<meld>joy
Good! Good, long time no see. ####<meld>joy
Like your sweater. ####<meld>neutral
Oh hey, right back at ya. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady? ####<meld>surprise
So whose is it? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
He is so weird. ####<meld>anger
You wanna fool around with Joey? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head! ####<meld>joy
And what's the big deal, people do it all the time! ####<meld>surprise
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around? ####<meld>surprise
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet. ####<meld>neutral
Who, who are they? ####<meld>neutral
I know them from work. ####<meld>neutral
Both of them? ####<meld>surprise
No, one of them... ####<meld>neutral
Which one? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, what were the names I just said? ####<meld>neutral
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated. ####<meld>anger
All right, all right, you're right ####<meld>sadness
What the hell are you cooking! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God! How did you get back here?! ####<meld>surprise
Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you? ####<meld>surprise
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute. ####<meld>anger
Thats not mine. ####<meld>neutral
Yes it is. ####<meld>neutral
How do you know? ####<meld>fear
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica." ####<meld>disgust
Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America! ####<meld>anger
Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them. ####<meld>neutral
Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off! ####<meld>anger
Theres a reset button under the plastic cover. ####<meld>neutral
Theres a reset button?! ####<meld>surprise
My God! ####<meld>surprise
Why didnt I see that! ####<meld>surprise
Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? ####<meld>neutral
Oh here it is! ####<meld>joy
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, God! ####<meld>joy
Four letters: "Circle or hoop". ####<meld>neutral
Ring dammit, ring! ####<meld>anger
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you know our phone's not working? ####<meld>surprise
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer. ####<meld>neutral
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off! ####<meld>anger
Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone? ####<meld>anger
Nngghhh!!!!!!! ####<meld>anger
Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please. ####<meld>neutral
"Heating device." ####<meld>neutral
Radiator. ####<meld>neutral
Five letters. ####<meld>neutral
Rdtor. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman. ####<meld>surprise
Well, you'll have to wait your turn. ####<meld>neutral
Well, how long do you think it'll be? ####<meld>neutral
Any minute now. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, this-  Heyy... ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Any good mail? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda. ####<meld>neutral
"Benefits lapsed." ####<meld>neutral
Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year. ####<meld>neutral
Let me see that! ####<meld>surprise
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I cant believe this! ####<meld>surprise
This sucks! ####<meld>anger
When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? ####<meld>fear
And it wouldnt matter. ####<meld>anger
Now I gotta be careful? ####<meld>anger
Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire. ####<meld>sadness
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street. ####<meld>neutral
look both ways before you cross the street. ####<meld>joy
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies! ####<meld>surprise
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing. ####<meld>joy
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex. ####<meld>neutral
Do you know anything about women? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
That's all right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. He could row like a viking. ####<meld>joy
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Mmm. ####<meld>neutral
So how'd it go? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, y'know.. ####<meld>neutral
Did he mention us? ####<meld>neutral
He said he's really gonna miss you guys. ####<meld>sadness
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. ####<meld>sadness
...love you. ####<meld>joy
Are you're hands still wet? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, moist, yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Let's dry 'em again. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Oh my God!! ####<meld>sadness
Still crying? ####<meld>surprise
Like a ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex. ####<meld>neutral
Whats the other one? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one. ####<meld>neutral
Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats right. ####<meld>joy
Youre the talker. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway uh, great idea! ####<meld>joy
Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, we have some ####<meld>neutral
No you dont! ####<meld>anger
Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, what town are we near? ####<meld>neutral
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg? ####<meld>neutral
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on? ####<meld>anger
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, no they dont do that. ####<meld>neutral
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us. ####<meld>neutral
Who? ####<meld>anger
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? ####<meld>fear
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up. ####<meld>neutral
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here! ####<meld>anger
But if... ####<meld>fear
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else. ####<meld>anger
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back. ####<meld>joy
So the going for help went well? ####<meld>neutral
Im telling you man, I saw it. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong. ####<meld>anger
Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh? ####<meld>sadness
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Lets try a lookof far offwonderment. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come. ####<meld>joy
Chandler! ####<meld>surprise
What is the matter with your face?! ####<meld>surprise
I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>anger
Dont laugh at him! ####<meld>anger
Hes ####<meld>neutral
Were gonna find love! ####<meld>joy
Definitely! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Im pretty confident about that. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! ####<meld>joy
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though. ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean? ####<meld>neutral
Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other. ####<meld>neutral
You mean a backup? ####<meld>neutral
Exactly! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, yeah I got that. ####<meld>neutral
You do? ####<meld>neutral
Hm-mmm ####<meld>neutral
Who? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I locked him years ago! ####<meld>joy
Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey. ####<meld>surprise
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, seriously? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Good morning. ####<meld>neutral
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night? ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game. ####<meld>joy
Ohh thats nice. ####<meld>joy
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women! ####<meld>joy
Wo-women? You mean like old women? ####<meld>disgust
Well kinda old, like 30. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night. ####<meld>surprise
Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh? ####<meld>surprise
A little. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
How you doin? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing! ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
So does it really hurt as bad as they say? ####<meld>joy
What did you just say? ####<meld>surprise
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight. ####<meld>joy
Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you. ####<meld>joy
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! ####<meld>joy
What do you say? ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right! ####<meld>joy
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one? ####<meld>anger
It went under the table. ####<meld>neutral
Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way! ####<meld>anger
Here it is! Here it is! ####<meld>joy
That could be a four or a five. It's your call. ####<meld>neutral
It's a four. ####<meld>neutral
I think so too. ####<meld>neutral
Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats. ####<meld>joy
Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you. ####<meld>joy
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now. ####<meld>neutral
Is there anything we can do for you? ####<meld>neutral
No just, nobody press on my stomach. ####<meld>neutral
You can keep those pants by the way. ####<meld>neutral
Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, you want some? ####<meld>neutral
Ah, just cut me a little sliver. ####<meld>joy
A little bigger. ####<meld>neutral
Little bigger. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Are you afraid youre gonna run out?! ####<meld>anger
Cut me a real piece! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Of course, of course. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, do you know each others hometowns? ####<meld>neutral
Why dont you   Wh-whats going on? ####<meld>fear
Well, umm, not much. ####<meld>neutral
But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
So, could I just move in with you for a couple days? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing..Why? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, you said it was urgent! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students? ####<meld>anger
Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies? ####<meld>neutral
Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this. ####<meld>sadness
Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you. ####<meld>fear
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. ####<meld>sadness
Your good heart Rach,  and, and.... ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>neutral
I cant, youre a totally different person to me now. ####<meld>sadness
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. ####<meld>sadness
God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. ####<meld>sadness
Its just changed, everything. ####<meld>sadness
Forever. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean. ####<meld>sadness
Then how come it is? ####<meld>sadness
Windows are clean, candels are lit. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. ####<meld>joy
Did I turn the fish? ####<meld>neutral
No, cause I made lasagne. ####<meld>neutral
Am I out of control? ####<meld>anger
Just a touch. ####<meld>neutral
Mon, I don't understand. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? ####<meld>surprise
I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Could tonight be the Night? ####<meld>joy
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. ####<meld>joy
Things happen, and they happen. ####<meld>joy
You don't plan these things. ####<meld>neutral
So, did you shave your legs? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! ####<meld>anger
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear
Is there a problem? ####<meld>neutral
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. ####<meld>neutral
But that's okay, no problem. ####<meld>neutral
No problem. ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, noodle soup. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup." ####<meld>neutral
Oh, what did I say? ####<meld>surprise
Hmm, noodle soup. ####<meld>neutral
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah! ####<meld>surprise
All right, let's try one. ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, noodle soup. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Let's do it again. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup! ####<meld>anger
COME ON!!!! ####<meld>anger
Y'know what? We need to move on. ####<meld>anger
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Give her some money. ####<meld>neutral
I really think theyre out of rooms. ####<meld>neutral
Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?! ####<meld>anger
Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up? ####<meld>neutral
This is a hospital. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Id have to say I really dont care for your tone. ####<meld>anger
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa! ####<meld>anger
Oh gosh! ####<meld>surprise
What-what? ####<meld>surprise
Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow! ####<meld>surprise
Would you like to see a semi-private room? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look. ####<meld>neutral
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half. ####<meld>neutral
That's funny. Who are they? ####<meld>joy
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend. ####<meld>neutral
You mean they're lovers. ####<meld>surprise
If you wanna put a label on it. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, uh, anything else I should know? ####<meld>surprise
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, quick and painful. ####<meld>neutral

Hi Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
How are ya? ####<meld>neutral
Good. ####<meld>neutral
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?! ####<meld>anger
Ooh, now you lost me. ####<meld>fear
You stole the phone! ####<meld>anger
No I didnt! ####<meld>anger
No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring? ####<meld>anger
No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work! ####<meld>fear
Phoebe! ####<meld>anger
Its not here. ####<meld>neutral
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there? ####<meld>neutral
How could I have left them in the copy room? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please. ####<meld>anger
Fine. ####<meld>anger
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya! ####<meld>joy
This will be your phone. ####<meld>neutral
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls. ####<meld>neutral
No you answer it and take pledges. ####<meld>neutral
But I'm the host! ####<meld>surprise
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones. ####<meld>neutral
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray. ####<meld>neutral
Well, here's your phone doctor. ####<meld>neutral
Hey guys. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs? ####<meld>surprise
Well, hes very charming. ####<meld>neutral
I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him. ####<meld>disgust
Well, youre just gonna have to try. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, where are the ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin em around... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go. ####<meld>anger
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! ####<meld>joy
Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break? ####<meld>surprise
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price? ####<meld>joy
I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband. ####<meld>joy
Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots. ####<meld>sadness
Come on more! ####<meld>anger
Oh God! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, you like that dont you? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah right there! ####<meld>joy
You want it there? You take it there baby! ####<meld>joy
Uh Phoebe? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now Im going to cover you back up, and umm were never doing this again. ####<meld>joy
Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy? ####<meld>anger
Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! ####<meld>anger
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! ####<meld>anger
I talk to you and its nothin. ####<meld>neutral
You look at me, and nothin. ####<meld>neutral
Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up here, tomorrow. ####<meld>joy
Well, that was ah... ####<meld>neutral
What?! What are you doing?! ####<meld>surprise
Do you know what just happened? ####<meld>anger
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep. ####<meld>neutral
No. We were in the middle of sexand ####<meld>neutral
Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world! ####<meld>joy
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. ####<meld>neutral
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, why is your bag moving? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, it's not! ####<meld>neutral
Seriously, it's moving! ####<meld>surprise
What the hell is in there? ####<meld>surprise
It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. ####<meld>neutral
There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. ####<meld>neutral
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. ####<meld>neutral
And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. ####<meld>anger
And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Rach? ####<meld>surprise
Ill be out in a second. ####<meld>neutral
Oh.  Its just so unexpected! II uhBoy Ill tell you its just such an honor to be nominated for a ####<meld>joy

Please, dont play the music. Just uh one more. ####<meld>joy
I can't believe you don't want to know. ####<meld>surprise
I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... ####<meld>joy
And Monica knows... ####<meld>neutral
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know! ####<meld>surprise
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me. ####<meld>neutral
So what's it gonna be? ####<meld>joy
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know! ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt! ####<meld>joy
Or an uncle... ####<meld>neutral
Hey Phoebe! ####<meld>joy
Hi Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe, what's the matter? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, right, that's me! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. ####<meld>neutral
Fine. ####<meld>neutral

More coffee over here, please! ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. What, what are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise

Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas.... ####<meld>neutral
Destiny. ####<meld>neutral
Sure. ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesnt look very fulfilled. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back. ####<meld>neutral
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist. ####<meld>anger
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones. ####<meld>neutral
So, what happens to the old guys? ####<meld>sadness
Well, they go into the chipper. ####<meld>neutral
Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!! ####<meld>fear
Hey! Hey!! ####<meld>surprise
Light still out? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Maybe they're- napping. ####<meld>neutral
Oh please, they're having sex. ####<meld>sadness
Shut up! ####<meld>anger
So, whaddya think George is like? ####<meld>neutral
I think he's shy. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean, ####<meld>joy
Arent you with that girl over there? ####<meld>neutral
Well, yeah, kinda. ####<meld>neutral
Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, no, its flattery. ####<meld>joy
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. ####<meld>joy
Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast. ####<meld>fear
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity... ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, for you. Is that the list? ####<meld>neutral
Um, yeah. ####<meld>neutral
May I see it? ####<meld>neutral
Um, no. ####<meld>fear
Come on! ####<meld>joy
But, okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im not on the list! ####<meld>surprise
Um, see, but thats not the final draft. ####<meld>neutral
Its laminated! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know its ironic... ####<meld>neutral
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. ####<meld>neutral
Were just gonna be friends. ####<meld>neutral
Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get! ####<meld>anger
Hey Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Ohh! You made up! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, get a room. ####<meld>disgust
We have one. ####<meld>neutral
I know. Use it. ####<meld>disgust
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot! ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani! ####<meld>surprise
Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break! ####<meld>anger
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me! ####<meld>anger
So thats the only reason she could be here huh? ####<meld>neutral
It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me! ####<meld>anger
I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later. ####<meld>neutral
Good-bye. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa! ####<meld>surprise
Uh, that was your sister actually. ####<meld>neutral
She-she thinks that youre just using me. ####<meld>neutral
So? ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
What are you doing here?! ####<meld>surprise
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Umm, okay, okay, look. ####<meld>neutral
I took this picture from your fridge. ####<meld>anger
Okay, because I know that this is my Father. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. ####<meld>anger
Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. ####<meld>anger
All right? ####<meld>anger
So if you can help me find my Father then you should! ####<meld>anger
Otherwise, youre just mean! ####<meld>anger
So, just tell me the truth! ####<meld>anger
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni. ####<meld>neutral
My Father is Chuck Magioni? ####<meld>surprise
No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! ####<meld>neutral
And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth. ####<meld>sadness
Oh. ####<meld>sadness
But umm, youre right. ####<meld>neutral
I think that a person should know where they come from. ####<meld>neutral
Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im your mother. ####<meld>neutral
Heh? ####<meld>surprise
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and... ####<meld>sadness
Whats happening to your accent? ####<meld>surprise
Come again? ####<meld>surprise
Whats-whats this nonsense? ####<meld>fear
All right, Im-Im not English. ####<meld>sadness
Im from Long Island. ####<meld>neutral
I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
So, if we could just get back to the lecture. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, were there any questions? ####<meld>neutral
About paleontology. ####<meld>neutral
All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. ####<meld>anger
Obviously, I screwed up. ####<meld>sadness
But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here. ####<meld>neutral
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression ####<meld>neutral
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am ####<meld>anger
Well, hello Rachel! ####<meld>surprise
Where you going, Joe? ####<meld>neutral
For a walk. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. You mind if I join you? ####<meld>neutral
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts. ####<meld>neutral
Your thoughts? Plural? ####<meld>surprise
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her! ####<meld>joy
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? ####<meld>anger
You guys are killing me! ####<meld>sadness
She's forbidden fruit! ####<meld>sadness
It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? ####<meld>sadness
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go. ####<meld>neutral
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of. ####<meld>anger
Great novels? ####<meld>surprise
Fine ... mediocre porn ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office. ####<meld>neutral
Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk. ####<meld>neutral
Thats kinda sad. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her, ####<meld>neutral
Got it! ####<meld>joy
Lets roll! ####<meld>joy
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan. ####<meld>neutral
Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? ####<meld>neutral
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! No problem! I ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
You are iron. ####<meld>neutral
You are steel! ####<meld>joy
Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half? ####<meld>anger
I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training? ####<meld>neutral
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?! ####<meld>surprise
Look, you and I went to different high schools... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school. ####<meld>neutral
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. ####<meld>neutral
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made. ####<meld>sadness
They had to have that specially made?! ####<meld>surprise
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot! ####<meld>surprise
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. ####<meld>surprise
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. ####<meld>joy
I-I owe her this. ####<meld>neutral
I never let her eat. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you go out with him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy? ####<meld>neutral
Ill try. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, okay. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.. ####<meld>joy
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow! ####<meld>anger
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know ####<meld>neutral
Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you. ####<meld>anger
Yeah but ####<meld>sadness
Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind. ####<meld>neutral
Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin! ####<meld>anger
Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie! ####<meld>joy
Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets! ####<meld>joy
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? ####<meld>joy
Sure! ####<meld>joy
He got it a flea market! ####<meld>joy
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little. ####<meld>disgust
And Joey? ####<meld>neutral
How do you think she's doing? ####<meld>neutral
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross? ####<meld>surprise
Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I .... ####<meld>surprise
Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Now that Rachel's gone? ####<meld>neutral
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, god help us. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww! ####<meld>disgust
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me. ####<meld>disgust
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please? ####<meld>sadness
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there. ####<meld>joy
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms. ####<meld>joy
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little. ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean? ####<meld>surprise
Carol our sex life isits just not working ####<meld>sadness
Hey there little fella! ####<meld>joy
Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on ya, huh? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! ####<meld>joy
Yay! ####<meld>joy
Yay! ####<meld>joy
Yay! ####<meld>joy
Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things. ####<meld>neutral
For fun? ####<meld>neutral
Like what? ####<meld>surprise
Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up? ####<meld>joy
Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. ####<meld>neutral
Nah! ####<meld>disgust
Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, we could, we could have a threesome. ####<meld>neutral
I love that idea! ####<meld>joy
So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box. ####<meld>anger
Oh my God, they took my idea! ####<meld>surprise
That was you?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Okay, here you go. ####<meld>joy
Rachel, I made you a cocoa. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, are you guys okay? ####<meld>surprise
Are you all right? ####<meld>surprise
Oh my. ####<meld>surprise
Sit! ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my gosh, Joshua! ####<meld>surprise
All those things I said about not being ready ####<meld>neutral
Theyre not true? ####<meld>fear
No, theyre-theyre all true. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>joy
But ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Oh, I love that but. ####<meld>surprise
You wanna go inside and have some coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Every time. ####<meld>neutral
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps! ####<meld>anger
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. ####<meld>sadness
Why would we do that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry! ####<meld>joy
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away. ####<meld>surprise
The balloon? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached ####<meld>neutral
I can't, I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen? ####<meld>surprise
Almost never. ####<meld>anger
Got the keys? ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
What d'you think? ####<meld>neutral
Lot of things. ####<meld>neutral
Which one do you think she is? ####<meld>neutral
May I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. ####<meld>neutral
You don't observe a dance class. You ####<meld>neutral
What does she mean? ####<meld>neutral
I think she means  'You ####<meld>neutral
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? ####<meld>anger
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again! ####<meld>anger
She could be you. ####<meld>neutral
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I'm not getting this! ####<meld>anger
I'm totally getting it! ####<meld>joy
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? ####<meld>sadness
What? You just click when they click. ####<meld>surprise
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Great. It's gym class all over again. ####<meld>disgust
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that. ####<meld>surprise
Nooo, it wasn't. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... ####<meld>joy
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day. ####<meld>joy
I know ####<meld>neutral
Open your drapes! Open your drapes! ####<meld>joy
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms! ####<meld>joy
The sun is out! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Remember when I had corneas? ####<meld>anger
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion. ####<meld>neutral
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Walls are pretty thin, guys! ####<meld>anger
Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids. ####<meld>joy
Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in? ####<meld>sadness
Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks.  Well but this one starts now. ####<meld>neutral
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. Its a twins study. ####<meld>neutral
But its $2,000. ####<meld>surprise
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists. ####<meld>neutral
We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good. ####<meld>joy
Hey! Hows it goin? ####<meld>neutral
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Yes it has! I made cookies! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato chips. ####<meld>neutral
But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ill be out in a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
That doesnt lock does it? ####<meld>neutral
You know, it still smells like monkey in there. ####<meld>disgust
That saves us a conversation. ####<meld>neutral
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped. ####<meld>neutral
Me too, we should get goin'. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, here comes another camera. ####<meld>neutral
Right. No biggie. Stay loose. ####<meld>neutral
Why do they keep doing that? ####<meld>neutral
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. ####<meld>neutral
Theyve been taping those people up there all day. ####<meld>neutral
Right. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there? ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants? ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Youre a good dancer! ####<meld>surprise
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little. ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean? ####<meld>neutral
Like this. ####<meld>neutral
Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no-no we came together! ####<meld>joy
I dont see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! ####<meld>neutral
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot. ####<meld>sadness
Really, ythink so? I dont.. ####<meld>anger
Why arent you home yet?! ####<meld>anger
Is someone there? ####<meld>anger
Oh yes, its me! Sorry! ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing here? ####<meld>neutral

Oh my God, look-look hes taking off her clothes! ####<meld>sadness
Hes taking off her coat! ####<meld>disgust
Oh, this is just terrible. ####<meld>disgust

Okay, break-ups still on! ####<meld>anger
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it. ####<meld>sadness
No, I dont want to hit you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh what then? Kick me? ####<meld>anger
No. ####<meld>neutral
My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out. ####<meld>fear
Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend ####<meld>joy
Sure! ####<meld>joy
Horny bitch.  No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre the horny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch! ####<meld>anger
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men! ####<meld>joy
Well, like father, like son. ####<meld>neutral
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious. ####<meld>joy
Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling. ####<meld>surprise
Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right? ####<meld>fear
Ummmmmmmm, no. ####<meld>neutral
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that! ####<meld>anger
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea. ####<meld>sadness
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Had that dream. ####<meld>neutral
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there. ####<meld>surprise
Instead of...? ####<meld>surprise
That's right. ####<meld>neutral
Never had that dream. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. ####<meld>neutral
Honey! Dinners ready! ####<meld>joy
Whats my little chef got for me tonight? ####<meld>joy
Your favorite! ####<meld>joy
Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese! ####<meld>joy
Yep! And lots of it! ####<meld>joy
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay. ####<meld>joy
Okay, in we go. ####<meld>joy
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin? ####<meld>joy
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. ####<meld>neutral
So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. ####<meld>joy
Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia. ####<meld>anger
Come on, they're close. ####<meld>neutral
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it? ####<meld>disgust
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean... ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god, what were you thinking? ####<meld>disgust
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Ow! ####<meld>surprise
I'm outta here. ####<meld>disgust
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up. ####<meld>neutral
Hello! One marriage please! ####<meld>joy
Yep, we wanna get married! ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum! ####<meld>joy
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that's ####<meld>neutral
No, only because that's the graduation song. ####<meld>neutral
Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married! ####<meld>joy
Are you sure you wanna do this? ####<meld>neutral
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! ####<meld>joy
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! ####<meld>joy
Wait!  Okay! ####<meld>neutral
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone? ####<meld>neutral
It depends on who asked. ####<meld>neutral
What if I asked? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Mon, sure. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yes.  Youre not asking are you? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Totally! ####<meld>joy
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened? ####<meld>joy
He asked you out?! ####<meld>surprise
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse. ####<meld>joy
Saucy! ####<meld>joy
What are these? ####<meld>neutral
Electrical plans for the building. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared? ####<meld>fear
I know that switch does something, okay? ####<meld>neutral
So-so I went down to city hall and got these. ####<meld>neutral
All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours. ####<meld>sadness
Wow! If only more people knew. ####<meld>surprise
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking. ####<meld>neutral
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, nobody's judging you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! ####<meld>joy
Oh man! ####<meld>surprise
I want that place so much!! ####<meld>joy
I was so sure that was gonna work! ####<meld>sadness
There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! ####<meld>disgust
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie. ####<meld>neutral
Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Bye Chandler!   I miss you already. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!! ####<meld>disgust
Actually, I did! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me? ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us! ####<meld>surprise
Are you serious? ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it! ####<meld>anger
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows! ####<meld>anger
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out. ####<meld>fear
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off. ####<meld>neutral
No, let's just leave the lights on. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go? ####<meld>anger
Oh fine. ####<meld>neutral
Ready?  Wrestle! ####<meld>joy
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area. ####<meld>neutral
Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance! ####<meld>fear
Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick. ####<meld>anger
All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke. ####<meld>neutral
Steady. ####<meld>neutral
Steady. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, a little higher. ####<meld>neutral
Careful of the angle. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay, were approaching the window  Thread the needle. ####<meld>neutral
Thread the needle. ####<meld>neutral
Hes alive! Hes a-live!!! ####<meld>joy
And yet, were still poking him. ####<meld>disgust
Okay, retract the device, retract the device. ####<meld>neutral
He does not look happy. ####<meld>anger
Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! ####<meld>anger
Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. ####<meld>sadness
Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. ####<meld>disgust
Oh God oh! ####<meld>surprise
Contraction! ####<meld>surprise
Are you looking at her?! ####<meld>anger
No! ####<meld>anger
Dont you look at her you sick bastard! ####<meld>anger
Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her! ####<meld>fear
Shes in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch! ####<meld>anger
Umm. Umm, Im-Im just gonna ####<meld>neutral
See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert! ####<meld>anger
No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. ####<meld>neutral
You miss your girlfriend? ####<meld>neutral
Just ignore them. ####<meld>neutral
Ross. ####<meld>neutral
What? What? ####<meld>fear
Hes looking at me. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?! ####<meld>anger

Alex Trebek? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, of course! ####<meld>joy
Chuck Woolery? ####<meld>neutral
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, whos ass I cannot kick. ####<meld>joy
Say it! ####<meld>joy
Say we are unagi! ####<meld>joy
Its not something you are! Its something you have! ####<meld>anger
Say it! ####<meld>joy
Yknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt! ####<meld>anger
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it's in there. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Ohh! Oh!! ####<meld>surprise
Joey, can I talk to you for a second? ####<meld>neutral
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!! ####<meld>surprise
oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh ####<meld>surprise
Yes. Yes. ####<meld>neutral
You?!  And-and you?! ####<meld>surprise
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows! ####<meld>joy
How?! When?! ####<meld>surprise
It happened in London. ####<meld>neutral
IN LONDON!!! ####<meld>surprise
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. ####<meld>neutral
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! ####<meld>surprise
No-no-no-no-no! You can't! ####<meld>fear
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell. ####<meld>fear
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's ####<meld>surprise
I know, it's great! ####<meld>joy
Aww, I don't want to see that! ####<meld>disgust
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey! ####<meld>sadness
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb. ####<meld>neutral
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb? ####<meld>neutral
No Cobb, as in cobb salad. ####<meld>neutral
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad? ####<meld>neutral
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do? ####<meld>fear
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby? ####<meld>surprise
You got a better idea? ####<meld>neutral
All right, call it in the air. ####<meld>neutral
Heads. ####<meld>neutral
Heads it is. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Whew! ####<meld>joy
We have to assign heads to something. ####<meld>neutral
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads. ####<meld>neutral
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday? ####<meld>anger
Okay, some tricks of the trade. ####<meld>neutral
Now, Ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. ####<meld>neutral
Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that Ive just done something evil. ####<meld>neutral
That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it  Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. ####<meld>neutral
And thats how its done. ####<meld>neutral
Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed. ####<meld>joy
Hey, Mr. Trib. ####<meld>neutral
Hey-hey. ####<meld>joy
Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down. ####<meld>neutral
Who are you? ####<meld>surprise
Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate. ####<meld>neutral
Im Chandlers new roommate. ####<meld>surprise
I-I-I dont think so. ####<meld>surprise
I could be Chandlers new roommate. ####<meld>surprise
But, he told me over the phone. ####<meld>surprise
He told me in person. ####<meld>neutral
Thats weird. ####<meld>surprise
Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Look who I found! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, hey guys! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter. ####<meld>neutral
Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? ####<meld>neutral
Didnt think so! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are! ####<meld>neutral
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage? ####<meld>anger
Hmm, how about my azzz? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, this is hollow. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!! ####<meld>surprise
No, dont look directly at them! ####<meld>fear
What? ####<meld>surprise
Alright, no, we could look at them! ####<meld>neutral
I ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. I-I wished youd called first. ####<meld>joy
Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good. ####<meld>joy
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, whats up? ####<meld>neutral
I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it. ####<meld>neutral
Ma, youre asking me to marry you? ####<meld>surprise
This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel. ####<meld>joy
Mom no, come on! Thank you. ####<meld>surprise
Just hear me out! ####<meld>fear
Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. ####<meld>sadness
I cant believe this! ####<meld>sadness
I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross. ####<meld>sadness
Youre, youre really, youre so good. ####<meld>sadness
Thanks. ####<meld>sadness
And youre so sweet.  And youre kind ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>sadness
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, its okay. ####<meld>neutral
Wait, wait, wait. ####<meld>joy
My foot is stuck in the pocket. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
No, I cant get it out. ####<meld>sadness
Rachel? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah.  Hi Mark! ####<meld>surprise
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I did! ####<meld>surprise

Oh my God!! ####<meld>surprise
Congratulations...oh..wow ####<meld>joy
I cant believe I did this! What an idiot! ####<meld>anger
Oh, stop beating yourself up! ####<meld>sadness
People make mistakes! ####<meld>neutral
These things happen! ####<meld>neutral
There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there? ####<meld>neutral
Apparently youre not very good at it! ####<meld>anger
I ####<meld>neutral
Philadelphia. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps. ####<meld>surprise
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>joy
But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot! ####<meld>sadness
Did you hear that?! ####<meld>neutral
I dont need you guys to care about me! ####<meld>anger
Because the universe cares! ####<meld>joy
The whole universe! ####<meld>joy
I really wished theyd care just a little bit though. ####<meld>sadness
I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and thats why I have to kill you." ####<meld>joy
They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me? ####<meld>surprise
Do you really want to pull at that thread? ####<meld>surprise
Im having a really good time! ####<meld>joy
Me too! Im sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck. ####<meld>sadness
Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend. ####<meld>neutral
Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go? ####<meld>fear
Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost. ####<meld>sadness
I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss andOh no! No! No! My God! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, dont freak out. Ill go. ####<meld>neutral
No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, umm thats Whitney , Kyles ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out? ####<meld>neutral
What?! No! ####<meld>surprise
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I dont think so Pheebs.  All right, Ill do it. But just because youre a friend. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings? ####<meld>neutral
I'll take sports. ####<meld>neutral
Mine! ####<meld>neutral
All right. Uhh, international. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say ####<meld>neutral
You two will have very hairy children. ####<meld>disgust
Okay, I didn't know you would say that. ####<meld>surprise
Ross! Janice?! ####<meld>anger
All right, hold on! ####<meld>neutral
Hold on. ####<meld>neutral
Hold on. ####<meld>neutral
This is Ross, okay? ####<meld>neutral
He's our friend. ####<meld>neutral
He obviously went crazy. ####<meld>anger
He obviously lost his mind. ####<meld>anger
So are you actually gonna see her again? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head! ####<meld>anger
Damnit Phoebe!! ####<meld>anger
Hey, dont we have to... ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we got, um-hmm. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I think youre really, really great... ####<meld>joy
Oh God! ####<meld>sadness
Here we go again. ####<meld>sadness
Why does this keep happening to me? ####<meld>anger
Is it something Im putting out there? ####<meld>sadness
Is this my fault? ####<meld>sadness
Or am I just nuts? ####<meld>sadness
I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say. ####<meld>surprise
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house. ####<meld>disgust
Wait! ####<meld>sadness
Terry! ####<meld>sadness
Please! ####<meld>sadness
Look, I just lost my other job. ####<meld>sadness
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
You have no idea how much I need this. ####<meld>sadness
Please, help me out, for old times sake. ####<meld>sadness
This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its hopeless. ####<meld>sadness
Its not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramorays a miracle worker. Look, here he comes. ####<meld>joy
Good morning.  Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me? ####<meld>neutral
Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha! ####<meld>joy
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane. ####<meld>anger
Well you did pull his hair. ####<meld>neutral
He took my snack! ####<meld>anger
Im not getting into this again! ####<meld>anger
Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad. ####<meld>sadness
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay. ####<meld>anger
This doesnt mean anything, does it? ####<meld>fear
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right? ####<meld>anger
That is true. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, you know you dont actually have one. ####<meld>neutral
Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her! ####<meld>sadness
Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me. ####<meld>anger
All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room. ####<meld>neutral
What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting! ####<meld>anger
The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while! ####<meld>neutral
But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me! ####<meld>anger
Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital. ####<meld>fear
But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years. ####<meld>neutral
I think thats gum. ####<meld>neutral
Im pretty sure its gun. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go. ####<meld>anger
A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do? ####<meld>anger
That was the only way I could get him to ####<meld>neutral
Hi! How are the Gellers? ####<meld>neutral
Dont call us that! ####<meld>anger
The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? ####<meld>anger
Hey! Its Porsche!! ####<meld>anger
Hey sweetie! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Theres no back to this couch! ####<meld>surprise
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you. ####<meld>joy
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest. ####<meld>neutral
Stop it! ####<meld>joy
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this. ####<meld>neutral
I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Of course he is! ####<meld>joy
What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse? ####<meld>joy
What kind of father do you think I am? ####<meld>anger
All right, sorry. ####<meld>neutral
I gotta go make a fake Ben. ####<meld>neutral
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy! ####<meld>surprise
Well, either that or uh ####<meld>neutral
Joey!! ####<meld>anger
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?! ####<meld>anger
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it! ####<meld>joy
They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!! ####<meld>joy
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!! ####<meld>joy
Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a ####<meld>anger

He is so cute! ####<meld>joy
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop thewowww. ####<meld>joy
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, isn't he? ####<meld>joy
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight. ####<meld>joy
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed. ####<meld>joy
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity. ####<meld>surprise
Huh. That's nice. ####<meld>neutral
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for ####<meld>neutral
Eight whole days. ####<meld>neutral
Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end. ####<meld>joy
Awesome! ####<meld>joy
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
My favorite part was when ####<meld>neutral
The Armadillo was actually not so ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunnys funeral in here. ####<meld>surprise
Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles! ####<meld>joy
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I understand why ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, sure. Good luck! ####<meld>joy
Im quitting!! Woo-hoo!  Im okay!! Im all right!! ####<meld>joy
Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No? ####<meld>surprise
Why would you say that? ####<meld>neutral
Cause youre still into Monica. ####<meld>neutral
So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and... ####<meld>neutral
Youre good. Youre good! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though? ####<meld>fear
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what? ####<meld>neutral
Thanks a lot. ####<meld>neutral
No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi. ####<meld>neutral
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! ####<meld>anger
Oh, hey, hey, I got that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thanks, sweetie. ####<meld>joy
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me? ####<meld>fear
No, no, they will. I just... uh... ####<meld>neutral
Can't wait. ####<meld>neutral
Do I know you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been? ####<meld>surprise
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now. ####<meld>neutral
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight. ####<meld>surprise
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage. ####<meld>joy
Uh, wait, backstage? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band. ####<meld>neutral
Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Look, you guys wanna meet the group? ####<meld>neutral
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad? ####<meld>surprise
Do you have any respect for your body? ####<meld>disgust
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? ####<meld>disgust
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. ####<meld>anger
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
He does? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, buddy, what's up! ####<meld>joy
Oh, she told you about that, huh. ####<meld>surprise
Well, yeah, I have one now and then. ####<meld>neutral
Well, yeah, now. ####<meld>neutral
Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. ####<meld>neutral
Well, okay, thanks! ####<meld>joy
God, he's good. ####<meld>joy
If only he were a woman. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, look look look. ####<meld>surprise
The last candle's about to burn out. ####<meld>neutral
10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Kinda... spooky without any lights. ####<meld>fear
Bwah-hah-hah! ####<meld>joy
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah... ####<meld>joy
Oh.. oh... oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica. ####<meld>neutral
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life? ####<meld>neutral
You blew them away! ####<meld>joy
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! ####<meld>joy
I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me? ####<meld>neutral
I was ####<meld>surprise
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God!  I'm your ####<meld>surprise
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room! ####<meld>joy
Look, I took it too far! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Monica: Right foot red. ####<meld>neutral
Could've played ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good. ####<meld>neutral
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the ####<meld>neutral
Oh, okay. Will you take my place? ####<meld>neutral
Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Nooo! ####<meld>surprise
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. ####<meld>joy
Green. To the green. ####<meld>neutral
I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind. ####<meld>neutral
To the left, to the left- aww! ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh... I'm fine. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Please tell me you got the message! ####<meld>fear
What message? ####<meld>neutral
The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Its 6 oclock! ####<meld>surprise
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! ####<meld>fear
I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! ####<meld>anger
I went to Rosss! ####<meld>neutral
I went to the coffeehouse! ####<meld>neutral
I went to any place that they made sandwiches! ####<meld>neutral
Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what you think. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe? ####<meld>neutral
Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse. ####<meld>neutral
What was her name? ####<meld>neutral
Nestley Toulouse. ####<meld>neutral
Nestlé Toll House? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language. ####<meld>neutral
Yes!!  Oh. ####<meld>surprise
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time! ####<meld>anger
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!! ####<meld>anger
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink? ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely! ####<meld>joy
I am so on board! ####<meld>joy
Rachel didn't you just light that? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach. ####<meld>neutral
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately. ####<meld>neutral
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like ####<meld>disgust
Tell me about it! ####<meld>neutral
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit! ####<meld>joy
It does sound appealing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I never could do it. ####<meld>joy
Oh but you could. ####<meld>neutral
You can. ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely! ####<meld>joy
We can help each other out! ####<meld>joy
We can get--what are those--those patches! ####<meld>neutral
We could be like the Patch Sisters! ####<meld>joy
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit! ####<meld>joy
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! ####<meld>joy
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding. ####<meld>sadness
Okay then! ####<meld>joy
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? ####<meld>neutral
Does, um, anyone wanna see? ####<meld>neutral
Nooo.. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! ####<meld>anger
It's worse than the thumb! ####<meld>disgust
Hey, this is so unfair! ####<meld>anger
Oh, why is it unfair? ####<meld>surprise
So I have a flaw! ####<meld>anger
Big deal! ####<meld>anger
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? ####<meld>anger
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? ####<meld>anger
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? ####<meld>anger
I mean, what the hell is that thing? ####<meld>disgust
...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? ####<meld>anger
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? ####<meld>anger
Well, I-I could live without it. ####<meld>neutral
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh,  "you do, do you"? ####<meld>anger
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. ####<meld>neutral
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. ####<meld>anger
Awww! Mel Torme died. ####<meld>sadness
Joey, that papers like a year old! ####<meld>neutral
Aw! Does that mean the ####<meld>sadness
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
You're sure? You're absolutely sure? ####<meld>neutral
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does. ####<meld>neutral
Probably? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I don't like that word. ####<meld>disgust
Kind of what probably really means. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" ####<meld>anger
You gotta take care of yourselves! ####<meld>neutral
In ####<meld>neutral
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? ####<meld>neutral
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride. ####<meld>joy
Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he? ####<meld>joy
Hes a keeper. How are you feeling? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Im fine. ####<meld>neutral
Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married? ####<meld>neutral
Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross! ####<meld>neutral
Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family. ####<meld>neutral
Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross. ####<meld>sadness
Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs. ####<meld>disgust
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. Whos that? ####<meld>neutral
New people. ####<meld>neutral
What happened to the Disgustingtons? ####<meld>neutral
Theyre having their baby! ####<meld>anger
Its not fair Ross we got here first! ####<meld>anger
Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. ####<meld>neutral
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people? ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Look at that guy by the window, wow! ####<meld>surprise
Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, what is wrong with me lately? ####<meld>sadness
I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here. ####<meld>neutral
Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack. ####<meld>neutral
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! So this has happened to you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh absolutely yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a ####<meld>neutral
Ugh! ####<meld>disgust
I dont know what Im going to do! ####<meld>fear
I called the company that sent and th-they dont care! ####<meld>anger
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is? ####<meld>anger
Hey guys! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey ####<meld>neutral
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! ####<meld>joy
And the guys from work had a blast. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so ####<meld>surprise
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, right! ####<meld>joy
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those ####<meld>neutral
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her. ####<meld>surprise
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? ####<meld>surprise
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life. ####<meld>joy
So you might say, its a magic ring. ####<meld>joy
OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!! ####<meld>surprise
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her. ####<meld>neutral
Obviously! So, how do we decide? ####<meld>neutral
Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her ####<meld>joy
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah well we should order some food then. ####<meld>neutral
No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well ####<meld>neutral
That sounds fair. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street ####<meld>neutral
Ah yeahwait a second now! ####<meld>anger
Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. ####<meld>neutral
I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that. ####<meld>anger
Well sorry, thats what I do on dates. ####<meld>neutral
All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates. ####<meld>neutral
So lets decide on the spending limit ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars? ####<meld>neutral
I was thinking more like a hundred. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars? ####<meld>neutral
Hi, again. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Thank you soo, much. ####<meld>joy
Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work. ####<meld>anger
You want some help with that? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont! ####<meld>neutral
Whoa! Are you okay? ####<meld>surprise
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush. ####<meld>surprise
Its the heat.  And-and the humidity. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a uh, thats a tough combination. ####<meld>neutral
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade? ####<meld>neutral
Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place. ####<meld>surprise
What do you mean? ####<meld>neutral
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, somebody left their keys. ####<meld>neutral
Ooohh, to a Porsche! ####<meld>surprise
Hey Gunther, these yours? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years! ####<meld>disgust
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys? ####<meld>neutral
Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found? ####<meld>neutral
Theres a lost and found?  My shoe! ####<meld>surprise
You left a shoe here?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I didnt realize until I got home. ####<meld>neutral
I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! ####<meld>neutral
Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe. ####<meld>neutral
Great! Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep. ####<meld>neutral
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? ####<meld>joy
We have a good time. ####<meld>joy
We laugh, we play. ####<meld>joy
It's like we're father and son. ####<meld>joy
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. ####<meld>joy
Oh, this is so cute. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I got that for him. ####<meld>neutral
My mommies love me. That's clever. ####<meld>joy
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew! ####<meld>neutral
Uh huh? ####<meld>neutral
Uh huh? ####<meld>neutral
Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great. ####<meld>neutral
See ya then. ####<meld>neutral
Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Did you just say Hi, Jew? ####<meld>surprise
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. ####<meld>neutral
Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes! ####<meld>joy
Thanks Monica! ####<meld>joy
Does that smell bother you? ####<meld>disgust
What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here. ####<meld>surprise
Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it. ####<meld>neutral
I can smell it a little, bake the pie. ####<meld>joy
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector. ####<meld>neutral
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, it was the candles. ####<meld>neutral
Its very not good leaving candles unattended. ####<meld>neutral
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I have to go now. ####<meld>neutral
Joey proposed to me. ####<meld>surprise
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I-I said yes. ####<meld>fear
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Are you crazy? ####<meld>anger
You just had Ross’s baby! ####<meld>anger
It’s-it’s so  inappropriate. ####<meld>anger
No, it’s worse than that. ####<meld>disgust
It’s wrong. ####<meld>disgust
It’s… It is bigger than  mine! ####<meld>surprise
I know. ####<meld>neutral
You can’t marry him! ####<meld>sadness
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much. ####<meld>sadness
Well do you love him? ####<meld>neutral
Sure. ####<meld>neutral
Sure? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I mean whatever. ####<meld>neutral
Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey? ####<meld>sadness
No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him? ####<meld>sadness
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart? ####<meld>neutral
Here comes the bride. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God Monica! ####<meld>surprise
I wanna wear this everyday. ####<meld>joy
You look so beautiful. ####<meld>joy
Im so happy for me. ####<meld>joy
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet? ####<meld>fear
Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine. ####<meld>neutral
Damnit! ####<meld>anger
I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay? ####<meld>anger
Fine. ####<meld>neutral
Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. ####<meld>anger
And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want! ####<meld>anger
No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I ####<meld>neutral
Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff! ####<meld>sadness
And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway! ####<meld>neutral
Crap!! ####<meld>anger
I gotta go! ####<meld>neutral
Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Me neither! We have to get in! ####<meld>surprise
Just act like you belong. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Oranges! ####<meld>surprise
Shh!  Nice to see you again. ####<meld>neutral
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, of course. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. ####<meld>joy
All I really needed was a plan. ####<meld>neutral
See I wanna have three kids ####<meld>neutral
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother. ####<meld>joy
As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years. ####<meld>neutral
You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed! ####<meld>joy
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically, ####<meld>anger
Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? ####<meld>anger
I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Why am I not surprised? ####<meld>disgust
Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this! ####<meld>anger
I dont think you have much choice. ####<meld>neutral
Well well see! ####<meld>anger
Bye-bye! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer? ####<meld>neutral
Yes. Yes. Just here  and there . ####<meld>neutral
Dad? ####<meld>neutral
Im here! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work. ####<meld>joy
Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house. ####<meld>sadness
Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling. ####<meld>neutral
Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories ####<meld>joy
Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven ####<meld>neutral
I used to ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a ####<meld>neutral
Ok, got the vent open. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue! ####<meld>joy
Ben, you ready? ####<meld>neutral
All right, gimme your foot. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, on three, Ben. ####<meld>neutral
One, two, three. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, That's it, Ben. ####<meld>neutral
What do you see? ####<meld>neutral
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebs, It's open! It's open! ####<meld>surprise
Wait! You forgot your legs! ####<meld>surprise
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system. ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Filing system? ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh! ####<meld>surprise
You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? ####<meld>neutral
It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets. ####<meld>joy
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that. ####<meld>neutral
I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me. ####<meld>joy
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost ####<meld>joy
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once! ####<meld>joy
Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I realize that ####<meld>neutral
And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean. ####<meld>neutral
I love working with designers! ####<meld>joy
With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach? ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, you have an assistant right? ####<meld>neutral
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick! ####<meld>fear
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile. ####<meld>neutral
I do? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Or not. ####<meld>neutral
Where's Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Here I am. ####<meld>neutral
Wash your hands!!! ####<meld>disgust
How did youknow? ####<meld>surprise
Hey! What's she doing back here? ####<meld>surprise
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! ####<meld>neutral
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... ####<meld>neutral
What happened in Atlantic City?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar ####<meld>neutral
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!" ####<meld>anger
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? ####<meld>neutral
So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. ####<meld>neutral
Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls. ####<meld>joy
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. ####<meld>anger
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard ####<meld>joy
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again? ####<meld>anger
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. ####<meld>neutral
So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you? ####<meld>neutral
Of course I am! ####<meld>joy
Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot. ####<meld>neutral
Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. ####<meld>neutral
And-and then guess what? ####<meld>neutral
The babys coming and I dont know what to do. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie? ####<meld>sadness
No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine. ####<meld>neutral
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going? ####<meld>fear
Im going to the bathroom. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
It ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty? ####<meld>surprise
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower. ####<meld>neutral
Not if you were here. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you! ####<meld>joy
I hope its you. ####<meld>neutral
Me too! ####<meld>joy
First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me ####<meld>joy
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?! ####<meld>joy
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other. ####<meld>neutral
Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine ####<meld>neutral
Yes!!! Oh!! ####<meld>joy
Hypothetically! ####<meld>anger
Still. ####<meld>neutral
If Phoebe were my maid of honor ####<meld>neutral
Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours? ####<meld>neutral
Well thats the best part. Umm, ####<meld>neutral
Wh-why is that the best part? ####<meld>surprise
Because then I dont have to! ####<meld>joy
Well of ####<meld>neutral
Im really not deciding! ####<meld>joy
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady! ####<meld>joy
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway? ####<meld>neutral
It's not just the drum noise. ####<meld>neutral
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! ####<meld>anger
Oh god, my eye!" ####<meld>anger
I mean, it is so annoying. ####<meld>anger
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore? ####<meld>surprise
Maybe on some level. ####<meld>neutral
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room? ####<meld>surprise
No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you. ####<meld>joy
And, a brownie! ####<meld>joy
Well, half a brownie. ####<meld>neutral
Actually, its just bag. ####<meld>neutral
Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so ####<meld>neutral
Oh man! ####<meld>joy
This is so great! ####<meld>joy
I actually feel like Im going on a real date! ####<meld>joy
Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere. ####<meld>neutral
Hey come on now, this is a real date. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, sonice place you got here. ####<meld>neutral
Foosball, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Pizza box. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, a subscription to ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, actually thats my roommates. ####<meld>neutral
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy. ####<meld>neutral
Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself. ####<meld>neutral
Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking? ####<meld>joy
Hm-mmm ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on! ####<meld>anger
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being? ####<meld>anger
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive. ####<meld>neutral
Ha. Ha, ha. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black. ####<meld>neutral
Please! I am not as bad as Ross. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, I beg to differ. The ####<meld>neutral
That was ####<meld>neutral
Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview! ####<meld>joy
Well, not playing raquetball! ####<meld>surprise
He forgot to leave his grip size! ####<meld>surprise
He didn't get the goggles! ####<meld>surprise
Well,sounds like you two have issues. ####<meld>neutral
Goodbye, baby. ####<meld>neutral
Ciao, bela. ####<meld>neutral
Do they wait for me to do this? ####<meld>neutral
So are you gonna tell him? ####<meld>neutral
Why would I tell him? ####<meld>neutral
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might. ####<meld>neutral
What are you guys doing here? ####<meld>anger
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap! ####<meld>surprise
...What did I ask? ####<meld>neutral
God. I feel violated. ####<meld>disgust
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do? ####<meld>disgust
Ross, ten o'clock. ####<meld>neutral
Is it? Feels like two. ####<meld>sadness
No, ####<meld>neutral
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! ####<meld>joy
Oh. Hel-lo! ####<meld>joy
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men! ####<meld>joy
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone. ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.' ####<meld>fear
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it! ####<meld>joy
Oh please, could she ####<meld>neutral
He could never get a woman like that in a million years. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys. ####<meld>neutral
You could do that! ####<meld>joy
You think? ####<meld>surprise
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down. ####<meld>neutral
OK. ####<meld>neutral
This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment? ####<meld>joy
Thank you Helen, that'll be all. ####<meld>neutral
Last time I do that, I promise. ####<meld>neutral
I am so, so, so, so sorry! ####<meld>sadness
Uh-huh. ####<meld>disgust
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there! ####<meld>fear
Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?! ####<meld>anger
Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please? ####<meld>sadness
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
So, are we going in there? ####<meld>neutral
I am!! ####<meld>joy
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
It actually is in the handbook. ####<meld>neutral
I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office. ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other. ####<meld>sadness
For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more. ####<meld>joy
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong. ####<meld>joy
Stop it! ####<meld>joy
No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo. ####<meld>joy
Shut the book! ####<meld>joy
Lets also get a hot plate! ####<meld>joy
Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends ####<meld>joy
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married? ####<meld>joy
Oh Im not, I just like to try these on. ####<meld>neutral
I do the same thing. ####<meld>neutral
Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25 ####<meld>joy
Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December. ####<meld>joy
So when are you getting married? ####<meld>neutral
Oh May 15 ####<meld>neutral
Oooh its getting close! ####<meld>joy
So uh, whos your photographer? ####<meld>neutral
Jeffrey ####<meld>neutral
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did? ####<meld>neutral
The best man? Wow! ####<meld>surprise
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?! ####<meld>joy
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass. ####<meld>sadness
Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great! ####<meld>joy
Oh yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off. ####<meld>neutral
This place is so overpriced. ####<meld>disgust
So, does this  come in another color or ####<meld>neutral
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. ####<meld>neutral
It was unbelievable! ####<meld>surprise
We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games... ####<meld>joy
So have you called her yet? ####<meld>neutral
Let her know I like her? ####<meld>fear
What are you, insane? ####<meld>anger
It's the next day! ####<meld>joy
How needy do I want to seem? ####<meld>neutral
I'm right, right? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney! ####<meld>anger
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine. ####<meld>neutral
Her answer machine? ####<meld>neutral
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up. ####<meld>neutral
So, uh, why didn't you say anything? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o." ####<meld>disgust
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, okay, what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, they're just talking... ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything? ####<meld>neutral
So, um, what do you do for a living? ####<meld>neutral
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. ####<meld>neutral
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Now that is funny. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? ####<meld>neutral
Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. ####<meld>sadness
I guess. ####<meld>neutral
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine. ####<meld>neutral
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
These people'll scooch down. ####<meld>neutral
You guys'll scooch, won't you? ####<meld>neutral
Let's try scooching! ####<meld>joy
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. ####<meld>neutral
Carol, Kristin. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. ####<meld>neutral
And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
When I was six years old. ####<meld>neutral
Hm-mm ####<meld>neutral
I wanted a big wheel. ####<meld>neutral
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. ####<meld>anger
It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me. ####<meld>sadness
That was a pretty tough year. ####<meld>sadness
Thats-thats great! ####<meld>joy
See? ####<meld>neutral
I already feel like I know you a little better! ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, come on. ####<meld>neutral
Now we can go eat. ####<meld>neutral
Lets go. ####<meld>neutral
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? ####<meld>anger
That's patio furniture! ####<meld>surprise
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course! ####<meld>neutral
What about the birds? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something." ####<meld>neutral
You pick one. ####<meld>neutral
All right, how about the ladybugs? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining! ####<meld>anger
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! ####<meld>anger
Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds! ####<meld>sadness
Bijan for men? ####<meld>neutral
Bijan for men? ####<meld>neutral
Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, actually I sorta have plans. ####<meld>neutral
Ready, Annabelle? ####<meld>neutral
You bet.  Maybe some other time? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?! ####<meld>sadness
That was amazing! ####<meld>joy
Phoebe and Gary are ####<meld>neutral
That was amazing. ####<meld>joy
We are the hottest! Huh? ####<meld>joy
No, you're the best. ####<meld>neutral
No, you're the best. ####<meld>neutral
No, you're the best. ####<meld>neutral
I ####<meld>neutral
Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day? ####<meld>neutral
So what are you gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out. ####<meld>sadness
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while? ####<meld>sadness
Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!! ####<meld>anger
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny. ####<meld>neutral
Why? What happened to him? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing, hes just really believes in that. ####<meld>neutral
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning. ####<meld>joy
Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos. ####<meld>neutral
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?" ####<meld>surprise
Um-hmm, five actually. ####<meld>neutral
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs? ####<meld>neutral
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach. ####<meld>neutral
Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there? ####<meld>neutral
Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. ####<meld>neutral
So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a ####<meld>disgust
No, Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! You guys really dont know anything! ####<meld>surprise
I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school. ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down! ####<meld>disgust
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?! ####<meld>anger
I don't know, clean places? ####<meld>neutral
Mm, yum! ####<meld>neutral
It's Danny. ####<meld>neutral
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala. ####<meld>fear
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later? ####<meld>anger
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?! ####<meld>surprise
The fake kind! ####<meld>anger
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle? ####<meld>neutral
We have a ladle. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks, see you at the party. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, great! ####<meld>joy
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle." ####<meld>neutral
You're so efficient. I love you! ####<meld>joy
Let's go! ####<meld>joy
No-no-no! We need something old! ####<meld>sadness
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve. ####<meld>neutral
That'll work! ####<meld>joy
I don't think so. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, now we just need something borrowed! ####<meld>joy
Here justtake this. ####<meld>neutral
That's stealing! ####<meld>sadness
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh. ####<meld>joy
Okay, one thing at a time. ####<meld>neutral
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, not much. I-I got a job. ####<meld>joy
Oh, that's great. ####<meld>joy
Why are- why are you so tanned? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba. ####<meld>neutral
Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk. ####<meld>joy
Oh God, oh. ####<meld>anger
Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried... ####<meld>sadness
Monica? Monica! ####<meld>anger
Water rules! ####<meld>joy
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work? ####<meld>neutral
Nope. Going to the ####<meld>neutral
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you! ####<meld>anger
No, it is me! ####<meld>joy
Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! ####<meld>anger
Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. ####<meld>joy
I'm- I'm Monana! ####<meld>joy
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people. ####<meld>neutral
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
They've arrested Monica. ####<meld>sadness
Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself. ####<meld>neutral
Now, do you have any idea what you just said? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! ####<meld>neutral
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y. ####<meld>neutral
I just... ####<meld>neutral
I wrote that out phonetically for you. ####<meld>neutral
Phonetically? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly! ####<meld>surprise
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy". ####<meld>joy
Wow. What does ####<meld>surprise
No idea! ####<meld>surprise
But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear". ####<meld>neutral
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! . ####<meld>neutral
Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't ####<meld>anger
Come on! you... ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Oh.  Oh-oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didnt you come up? ####<meld>surprise
Done! ####<meld>joy
You just finished? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I wanted to be thorough. ####<meld>neutral
I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! ####<meld>joy
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice! ####<meld>joy
So umm, does it? ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Does it? ####<meld>fear
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance. ####<meld>neutral
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! ####<meld>anger
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even ####<meld>anger
No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont ####<meld>neutral
Are you sure? ####<meld>joy
Oh, sure! Im sure. ####<meld>joy
You got married again. ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
So thats your second marriage in two years. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, second in two years. Third overall. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. ####<meld>neutral
Why dont you tell me what happened. ####<meld>neutral
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage? ####<meld>surprise
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thats better then. ####<meld>neutral
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled. ####<meld>neutral
I see. Have you considered therapy? ####<meld>neutral
I think just the ####<meld>neutral
There are a couple of forms to fill out. ####<meld>neutral
Easy. ####<meld>neutral
And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind. ####<meld>neutral
No problem. ####<meld>neutral
And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh! ####<meld>surprise
Theres no way to do this without her? ####<meld>surprise
Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of. ####<meld>fear
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones. ####<meld>neutral
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game. ####<meld>neutral
Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. ####<meld>neutral
That's alright, I'll take it. ####<meld>neutral
Bad things happen to me anyway. ####<meld>neutral
This way I can break 'em up with a movie. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen... ####<meld>neutral
You wanna do it right now? ####<meld>neutral
Great! ####<meld>joy
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from ####<meld>neutral
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you. ####<meld>neutral
You're welcome. ####<meld>neutral
is for me not to see you anymore. ####<meld>sadness
That's crazy! ####<meld>surprise
You can't do that! ####<meld>surprise
What are you going to tell her? ####<meld>sadness
Oh God. ####<meld>fear
Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you? ####<meld>sadness
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. ####<meld>sadness
And I do, I have to make ####<meld>sadness
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That ####<meld>surprise
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard. ####<meld>sadness
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you. ####<meld>anger
What are you doing? ####<meld>surprise
Storming out! ####<meld>anger
Rachel, this is your apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!! ####<meld>anger

Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. ####<meld>neutral
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker. ####<meld>neutral
You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Chandler! ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift." ####<meld>joy
Oh, well thank you in advance. ####<meld>joy
Op, but the twelfth brings a lovers spat. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself. ####<meld>surprise
Hey guys! ####<meld>neutral
Hey!! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick? ####<meld>joy
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? Ive dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?! ####<meld>joy
No! Joey, youre going to be great! ####<meld>neutral
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything about technology! ####<meld>fear
I cant even use Chandlers computer except to find porn! ####<meld>anger
And-and thats only cause its right there when you turn it on! ####<meld>anger
I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month. ####<meld>anger
Ill be waiting. ####<meld>neutral
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay? ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here. ####<meld>surprise
I know! ####<meld>surprise
Now look, theres only one problem though. ####<meld>joy
Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys. ####<meld>neutral
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no ones fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident. ####<meld>neutral
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
So Rach! ####<meld>joy

This is just Bactine. It won't hurt. ####<meld>neutral
Sorry, that was wax. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner. ####<meld>sadness
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall? ####<meld>disgust
During a blackout? He'd get trampled! ####<meld>sadness
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. ####<meld>sadness
But I'll still always come back, like this. ####<meld>neutral
And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. ####<meld>neutral
But I'll still always come back, like this. ####<meld>neutral
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. ####<meld>neutral
He is so amazing. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know. Look at him. ####<meld>joy
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name. ####<meld>neutral

Hi Bob! ####<meld>joy
I thought I told you to get outta here! ####<meld>anger
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot. ####<meld>neutral

Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift. ####<meld>joy
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! ####<meld>anger
How can I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? ####<meld>anger
See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it. ####<meld>anger
We are aware of the problem you are referring to. ####<meld>neutral
But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the library is very understaffed. ####<meld>neutral
I, I cant help you. ####<meld>sadness
Well, fine. ####<meld>anger
Fine! ####<meld>anger
If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself! ####<meld>anger
And dont you follow me! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Phoebe look, its Ross and that girl. ####<meld>surprise
No! No! Look at that!  Its a line of ants! Theyre working as a team! ####<meld>surprise

They are not breaking up, look at them. ####<meld>neutral
Okay thats, you know what that is? ####<meld>neutral
That is a, that is a second date, thats what that is! ####<meld>sadness
Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh... ####<meld>neutral

The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time. ####<meld>neutral
You still work at the multiplex? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, like Id give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room. ####<meld>joy

Okay. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no! ####<meld>fear
YES!! ####<meld>joy
Uh fellas, ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so he's out of here. ####<meld>neutral

So you risked your life, for a sandwich! ####<meld>joy
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world! ####<meld>joy
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me. ####<meld>sadness

Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys? ####<meld>fear
Let's see. ####<meld>neutral
Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports. ####<meld>neutral

Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler! ####<meld>surprise

Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back. ####<meld>neutral
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black? ####<meld>neutral
Well, you-you know what I meant. ####<meld>neutral
No, you messed it up. Youre stupid. ####<meld>anger
So what job did you get Joe? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something? ####<meld>neutral

Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a ####<meld>neutral
It just keeps getting worse and worse! ####<meld>anger
I mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows. ####<meld>neutral
Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us. ####<meld>neutral
And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. ####<meld>neutral
And now I have seen her naked. ####<meld>neutral
I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. ####<meld>neutral
But there are no boles, shes smooth! ####<meld>neutral
Smooth! ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
So, you and Angela, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yep. Pretty much. ####<meld>joy
Oh, that's what she meant! ####<meld>surprise
You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! ####<meld>neutral
You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, most of it it's a place ####<meld>neutral
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison    Avenue. ####<meld>neutral
You know what? ####<meld>neutral
She loves architecture, you know what you should do? ####<meld>neutral
You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love. ####<meld>joy
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! ####<meld>surprise
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food... ####<meld>neutral

Sorry, I justcant sleep. ####<meld>surprise
Ooh! ####<meld>anger
Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? ####<meld>neutral
Because every time I look at that cover Im like ####<meld>neutral
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section ####<meld>sadness
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral

Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic isOh my God! ####<meld>surprise
What? What happened to the window in the attic?! ####<meld>surprise
I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house! ####<meld>anger

I cant believe I still dont know what happened to the ####<meld>surprise
Nothing? ####<meld>neutral
Look, you and I have been given a gift. ####<meld>neutral

And-and-and I wrote a song for us! ####<meld>joy
(Singing, to the tune of ####<meld>joy
That's okay. ####<meld>neutral
But you haven't even heard the chorus! ####<meld>neutral
Well, shell understand right? Its not like I did it on purpose. ####<meld>sadness
Dad, that wont matter to her. ####<meld>neutral
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff! ####<meld>anger
See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her. ####<meld>anger
Oh my God, does she really thinks that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, can you blame her? ####<meld>sadness
Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could ####<meld>joy
Dad, dad I dont want to hear about it. ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise

Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want. ####<meld>joy
You could? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat. ####<meld>joy
Your own boat? ####<meld>surprise
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick. ####<meld>surprise
Hes coming here for Thanksgiving! ####<meld>joy
Count in our heads as-as good ####<meld>anger
I guess I'm done. ####<meld>neutral
Fun’s over ####<meld>joy
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something! ####<meld>fear
I think I'm gonna take-off. ####<meld>neutral
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh! ####<meld>joy
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it ####<meld>neutral
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'... ####<meld>neutral
Do you want a date Saturday? ####<meld>neutral
Yes please. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's- ####<meld>neutral

Okay, goodbye... ####<meld>disgust
Well, it's official there are no good movies. ####<meld>sadness
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. ####<meld>neutral
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, man. What's up? ####<meld>neutral
Maybe you can tell me. ####<meld>neutral
My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. ####<meld>anger
The first good thing she gets me in weeks. ####<meld>neutral
How could you not give me the message? ####<meld>anger
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me. ####<meld>anger
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me! ####<meld>anger
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed. ####<meld>neutral
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you? ####<meld>neutral
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie? ####<meld>surprise
Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me. ####<meld>sadness
Whoa! ####<meld>surprise
Whoa what? ####<meld>surprise
Ross has a boyfriend. ####<meld>neutral

I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. ####<meld>anger
What-what-what-what is it?! ####<meld>joy
Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe? ####<meld>anger
Not right now. ####<meld>neutral
It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! ####<meld>sadness
I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! ####<meld>joy
Yknow youI couldnt concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. ####<meld>neutral
I mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in love. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh thats-thats actually how the French drink it. ####<meld>joy
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes! ####<meld>joy

That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now? ####<meld>joy
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6? ####<meld>neutral

Take as much time as you want. ####<meld>neutral
Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. ####<meld>neutral
Ill be here. ####<meld>sadness
Not smoking. ####<meld>sadness
Were really gonna do this, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Looks like it. ####<meld>neutral

Im-Im Ross by the way. ####<meld>neutral
Hello Ross.  I love what youve done with this space. ####<meld>joy
Thank you so much. ####<meld>joy
How hot is this?! ####<meld>surprise
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm ####<meld>neutral
G.I. Joe ####<meld>neutral
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas! ####<meld>joy
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid. ####<meld>sadness
That, that's what's stupid. ####<meld>disgust
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. ####<meld>neutral
And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Down at the docks again? ####<meld>anger
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell? ####<meld>neutral
Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke Sarahs leg. ####<meld>anger
Hey now! That was an accident, okay. ####<meld>anger
Youre a big scrud. ####<meld>anger
Whats a scrud? ####<meld>neutral
Why dont you look in the mirror, scrud. ####<meld>anger
I dont have too. I can just look at you. ####<meld>joy
All right girls, and man. Lets see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice. ####<meld>joy
Not nice enough. ####<meld>anger
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good. ####<meld>neutral
So, howd the lasagne go over? ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Good. ####<meld>neutral
So you owe me three pretty things. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too. ####<meld>neutral
Its hard this whole platonic thing. ####<meld>sadness
Its a word! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I do think its better this way.  Yeah, were being smart.   Yes, Im sure. ####<meld>neutral
You really sure? ####<meld>neutral
Ill call you back. ####<meld>neutral
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man? ####<meld>surprise
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. ####<meld>neutral
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. ####<meld>neutral
I am ####<meld>neutral
I think you're better than you think you are. ####<meld>neutral
Really? Okay, so ####<meld>surprise
Know when to stop. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance. ####<meld>neutral

Thats my job! ####<meld>anger
Are you being British?! ####<meld>surprise
No. Not anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. ####<meld>neutral
Barley? What kind of party serves barley? ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours. ####<meld>anger
Where is this party? ####<meld>neutral
Here in Chelsea. ####<meld>neutral
Who's party is it? ####<meld>anger
A woman's ####<meld>neutral
What woman?! ####<meld>anger
Chelsea. ####<meld>neutral
Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. ####<meld>disgust
Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. ####<meld>disgust
So like which of these two guys do you want to be? ####<meld>sadness
Can I be that guy? ####<meld>joy
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo! ####<meld>joy
Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going. ####<meld>anger
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay! ####<meld>fear
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you. ####<meld>surprise
Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no! ####<meld>anger
Did you just flick me? ####<meld>anger
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica] ####<meld>joy
Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this! ####<meld>anger
Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts! ####<meld>anger

Ow! Ow! Ow! ####<meld>anger
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop. ####<meld>neutral
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Fine! ####<meld>anger
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise

Thats a great idea! We can ####<meld>joy
Totally! ####<meld>joy
We dont have to come up with this now. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover. ####<meld>neutral
Thats great. Good for you guys. ####<meld>joy
I am not high maintenance! ####<meld>anger
I am not a pushover! ####<meld>anger
Who said you were? ####<meld>neutral
You did! ####<meld>anger
Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do. ####<meld>joy
That does not sound stupid to me. ####<meld>neutral
You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. ####<meld>sadness
Next on Ross... Uh-oh. ####<meld>neutral
What uh-oh? ####<meld>joy

Okay, ####<meld>neutral
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming! ####<meld>anger
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this? ####<meld>disgust
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun? ####<meld>anger
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight! ####<meld>anger
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms? ####<meld>anger
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas! ####<meld>anger
Do not speak ill of the dead. ####<meld>anger
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you? ####<meld>anger
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom. ####<meld>sadness
What did you say? ####<meld>anger
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn." ####<meld>fear
Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Yknow, technically we still ####<meld>neutral
Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a bit? ####<meld>neutral
Kay! ####<meld>neutral
Can I ask you something? ####<meld>neutral

Yes. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks man. ####<meld>neutral
Okay man. ####<meld>neutral
But what about how much taller he is than me? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man? ####<meld>anger
Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour. ####<meld>surprise

Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, yknow what? ####<meld>surprise
Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff. ####<meld>neutral

You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion. ####<meld>neutral

Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get yknow, real  nice and tight. ####<meld>neutral
So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area. ####<meld>surprise

Are you kidding me?! ####<meld>anger
It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?! ####<meld>anger
I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! ####<meld>anger
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you. ####<meld>neutral

Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh. ####<meld>neutral
Is there something wrong? ####<meld>neutral
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? ####<meld>neutral
You're hot. ####<meld>neutral
I'm lovable. ####<meld>neutral
Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. ####<meld>neutral
But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. ####<meld>neutral
Joey... ####<meld>neutral
Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im ####<meld>fear
Ho-oh, hes gonna get some! ####<meld>joy
Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Im off to bed! ####<meld>neutral
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! ####<meld>joy
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny. ####<meld>joy
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! ####<meld>joy
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. ####<meld>fear
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, look I like you. ####<meld>fear
I-I really do, I like you a lot. ####<meld>fear
Okay? ####<meld>anger
But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very ####<meld>joy
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, Joey! Sorry! ####<meld>surprise
They made you head of the department! ####<meld>joy
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didnt I get head of the department? ####<meld>joy
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant? ####<meld>neutral

Ooh, I miss dating. ####<meld>sadness
Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. ####<meld>neutral
Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun! ####<meld>joy
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
Why dont I take you out? ####<meld>neutral
What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady. ####<meld>surprise
Yes I do! ####<meld>joy
And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out ####<meld>joy
Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya. ####<meld>joy
Ill be fun. ####<meld>neutral
All right? ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good ####<meld>joy
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow! ####<meld>joy
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me? ####<meld>surprise
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Oh screw her, that part is mine! ####<meld>anger
Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here. ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe you married him. ####<meld>surprise
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a ####<meld>anger
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other. ####<meld>sadness
It's over! You ####<meld>joy
How can I? ####<meld>surprise
Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? ####<meld>sadness
How can I accept that... ####<meld>sadness
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now. ####<meld>sadness
Kiss me. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for? ####<meld>joy
The bigger half. ####<meld>neutral
I'd like to propose a toast. ####<meld>joy
Little toast here, ding ding. ####<meld>joy
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. ####<meld>joy
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? ####<meld>anger
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. ####<meld>joy
That's so sweet. ####<meld>joy
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. ####<meld>joy
And a crappy New Year. ####<meld>joy
Here, here! ####<meld>joy
Now, hold on! ####<meld>anger
Hold on! ####<meld>anger
Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that Im gonna be at that airport and I hope that shell be there too! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah, I said Rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay? ####<meld>anger
Shes-shes just a friend and thats all! ####<meld>anger
Thats all! ####<meld>sadness
Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else. ####<meld>anger
Please, promise me that youll tell her that. ####<meld>sadness
All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face! ####<meld>anger
Call me. ####<meld>neutral
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window! ####<meld>anger
What happened?!! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I dont know!! ####<meld>surprise
We fell asleep! That is all. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go. ####<meld>neutral
I think that would be best. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. But not about this! ####<meld>anger
No! Never! Never!  Bye. ####<meld>anger
No touch! No touch! ####<meld>neutral
Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
It’s a funny story, actually. ####<meld>neutral
I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying. ####<meld>neutral
You fell asleep? ####<meld>surprise
But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny? ####<meld>fear
Irony? ####<meld>surprise
Not a fan, alright . ####<meld>neutral
See, here’s  the thing. ####<meld>neutral
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. ####<meld>neutral
See, me, I  love Tulsa! ####<meld>joy
Tulsa is heaven! ####<meld>joy
Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go  there! ####<meld>fear
Chandler, I… ####<meld>joy
No no no! ####<meld>fear
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? ####<meld>neutral
Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine? ####<meld>joy
Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping! ####<meld>joy
That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it,  well she’s lovely. ####<meld>joy
I like a girl with a strong jaw. ####<meld>sadness
I’ll call you from Tulsa. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
How are you? ####<meld>neutral
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here? ####<meld>neutral
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. ####<meld>neutral
That I was not expecting. ####<meld>surprise
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing ####<meld>joy
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'. ####<meld>neutral
I just can't believe you're in here. ####<meld>surprise
I mean, what am I gonna do without you? ####<meld>sadness
Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? ####<meld>sadness
Who's gonna take me to the ####<meld>sadness
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid. ####<meld>disgust
What do you mean? ####<meld>neutral
Smell familiar? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no. ####<meld>fear
Oh, I am so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
No me, I am so sorry... ####<meld>sadness
Oh my. ####<meld>surprise
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. ####<meld>fear
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. ####<meld>fear
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles. ####<meld>neutral
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea? ####<meld>neutral
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. ####<meld>neutral
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. ####<meld>neutral
Tho? ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh. ####<meld>fear
That's good, have a seat. ####<meld>neutral
Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. ####<meld>neutral
You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? ####<meld>neutral
Can you do that for me? ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! ####<meld>fear
All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. ####<meld>neutral
Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! ####<meld>anger
Let go of my hand! ####<meld>anger
Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?! ####<meld>joy
Welllets just say ####<meld>neutral
Oo, where are the seats? ####<meld>joy
Uh, middle balcony. ####<meld>neutral
Youre a mean old woman. ####<meld>anger
No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook! ####<meld>sadness
Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay? ####<meld>surprise
Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. ####<meld>joy
Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity! ####<meld>joy
Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love! ####<meld>joy
That means nothing to me.  Come on! ####<meld>anger
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger. ####<meld>fear
: What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Ummm. Oh! Im sorry.  Its a little old but ####<meld>joy
: No! Youre clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging! ####<meld>anger
Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot. ####<meld>sadness
: Oh yeah, of course you dont! ####<meld>anger
: Cause youre a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of ####<meld>disgust
: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? ####<meld>anger
Well, why dont think of someone else for a change? ####<meld>anger
Okay, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Hello! ####<meld>joy
What's this? ####<meld>neutral
Oh right its that girl's phone number. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. ####<meld>joy
It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! ####<meld>surprise
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. ####<meld>anger
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
I dont know how any of these got opened?! ####<meld>surprise
You opened them all? ####<meld>surprise
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again! ####<meld>joy
Oh hey! You got my parents gift! ####<meld>joy
Yeah. What is that? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! Howd it go? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. What-what did Tag say? ####<meld>neutral
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now? ####<meld>sadness
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. ####<meld>joy
Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra! ####<meld>surprise
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is? ####<meld>neutral
No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youre not gonna be alone in this. ####<meld>joy
Im not? ####<meld>surprise
Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom. ####<meld>fear
Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. ####<meld>neutral
So,  Rachel Green will you marry me? ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
If I cant have it you cant have it! ####<meld>anger
I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical. ####<meld>disgust
Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. ####<meld>neutral
There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and ####<meld>neutral
Paris? ####<meld>neutral
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la . ####<meld>neutral
Keep talking. ####<meld>neutral
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can! ####<meld>joy
I love you! ####<meld>joy
Yes! ####<meld>joy
I win again! ####<meld>joy
Ha-ha! ####<meld>joy
Thats like 500 bucks you owe me! ####<meld>joy
Whoo-ho-hoo! ####<meld>joy

Whoo-ho-ho! ####<meld>joy

Okay, get ready to owe me! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, here we go. Ready? ####<meld>neutral
No! No! No! Noone can beat me. ####<meld>anger
See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. ####<meld>fear
Who is that?! ####<meld>surprise
Dont worry, Im brave! ####<meld>sadness
I am brave! ####<meld>fear
II am brave! ####<meld>fear
No-no-no-no!! ####<meld>fear

So, can I get some candy? ####<meld>neutral

Um-hmm. ####<meld>neutral
Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you! ####<meld>surprise
Mm! Night Gar! ####<meld>neutral
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered! ####<meld>joy
Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting. ####<meld>neutral
You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork? ####<meld>neutral
So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day. ####<meld>neutral
Well have we finished the scene? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Youyou were wonderful. ####<meld>joy

So I got your car, its right outside. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thank you. Youre welcome. ####<meld>joy
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go. ####<meld>fear
Is that my ass? ####<meld>joy
What about these? These look the same? ####<meld>neutral
Definitely! ####<meld>joy
Not as each other! ####<meld>neutral
Oh, then no. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>anger
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier. ####<meld>joy
Let me see the earrings. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, honey, the earrings ####<meld>neutral
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what? ####<meld>joy
My boyfriend really does have good taste! ####<meld>joy
Thanks for picking out the earrings man. ####<meld>neutral
Mm-Hm ####<meld>neutral
I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Look at this! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, but there ####<meld>neutral
I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head! ####<meld>anger
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did. ####<meld>neutral
And did you?! ####<meld>sadness
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs. ####<meld>neutral
But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Hello darling. ####<meld>neutral
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, is everybody clear? Were gonna pick it upand move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna ####<meld>neutral

Lift!! And slide! ####<meld>joy
Okay, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
All right everyone, lift!  And slide!! ####<meld>joy

Another ####<meld>neutral
Thats right! And what are you not gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
Well, Im not gonna talk because ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but ####<meld>sadness
Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand. ####<meld>sadness
I-I am so sorry, Ill go. ####<meld>sadness
Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. ####<meld>sadness
Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper. ####<meld>neutral
I found my identical hand twin! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, you are ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>neutral
But she just came up here! ####<meld>surprise
That was Joey! ####<meld>neutral
I wonder where she is. That is so weird. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard. ####<meld>neutral
Would you stop that! ####<meld>anger
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? ####<meld>neutral
She didn't feel anything for him. ####<meld>neutral
She loves you! ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her. ####<meld>anger
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Good.  I should really start wearing hats! ####<meld>neutral
I mean, why should I let them meet him? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. ####<meld>disgust
I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. ####<meld>joy
Listen. ####<meld>neutral
As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. ####<meld>neutral
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. ####<meld>sadness
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no.  Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye. ####<meld>neutral
Hey sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering? ####<meld>neutral
I cant tell you. Its a secret. ####<meld>neutral
Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another. ####<meld>anger
Awww.  But still no. ####<meld>neutral
No Im serious, we should tell each other ####<meld>neutral
Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at ####<meld>neutral

If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral

Oh! You got it?! ####<meld>sadness
Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good. ####<meld>joy
What was it for? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, its this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. ####<meld>neutral
Its really classy! ####<meld>joy
Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese. ####<meld>joy

Grandmas gonna have to get in line. ####<meld>joy
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me! ####<meld>joy
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson. ####<meld>surprise
Who? ####<meld>neutral
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyones name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. ####<meld>neutral
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, no. No. ####<meld>neutral
Yes you did! What was it? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, its Cutie McPretty. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh thats so sweet! ####<meld>joy
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Im having a great time! ####<meld>joy
Yknow how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but its not. ####<meld>surprise
I mean its not at all. ####<meld>neutral
Dr. Geller! ####<meld>joy
Burt! ####<meld>joy
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, shoot. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial. ####<meld>neutral
I didn't get it? ####<meld>neutral
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that. ####<meld>joy
Okay, what else? ####<meld>neutral
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.' ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>sadness
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.' ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral

Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, what are you doing? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me. ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that. ####<meld>disgust
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything. ####<meld>joy
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles? ####<meld>surprise
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her? ####<meld>surprise
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order. ####<meld>disgust
What are you saying I should do? ####<meld>neutral
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, Monica. ####<meld>joy
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine. ####<meld>surprise
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper! ####<meld>joy
Ooh, lets see it! ####<meld>joy

Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine. ####<meld>neutral
So then you know? ####<meld>joy

Well, you know, no suds, no save. ####<meld>neutral
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine. ####<meld>anger
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. ####<meld>anger
Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine! ####<meld>anger
Well, I think this is a great place to work! ####<meld>joy
Ok, are they listening? ####<meld>anger

This is the first time in my life Im doing something that Im actually good at. ####<meld>anger
I mean. ####<meld>neutral
if you dont get that... ####<meld>anger
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. ####<meld>anger
And Im happy for ya, but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I dont know what to do anymore. ####<meld>sadness

Oh, yeah! How did you meet her? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, which museum? ####<meld>neutral
No, answer his. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. ####<meld>joy
She was totally at my mercy. ####<meld>joy
Were you so late because you were burring this woman? ####<meld>sadness
No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. ####<meld>neutral
She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away. ####<meld>joy
How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany. ####<meld>anger
Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now? ####<meld>joy
No, there is no way! It can ####<meld>joy
Why is your family ####<meld>neutral
He cannot play at our wedding! ####<meld>anger

If you listen very carefully, I think its ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes! ####<meld>surprise
So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, sure. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they? ####<meld>neutral
Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over? ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
You see, now, I would date this girl. ####<meld>neutral
Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, thats got to come in handy ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Me neither. ####<meld>neutral
Rachel. ####<meld>neutral

I dont know.  Me neither. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I wanted to tell Im-Im sorry you lost. ####<meld>sadness

Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island? ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten ####<meld>surprise
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island. ####<meld>surprise
Also an island. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, what time is it? ####<meld>neutral
2:17. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? ####<meld>surprise
Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose! ####<meld>anger
Hey, you guys ####<meld>neutral

And shame on all of you! ####<meld>disgust
Youre disgusting! ####<meld>disgust
Especially you  with that! ####<meld>disgust
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Are you moving out? ####<meld>neutral
No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's. ####<meld>neutral
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec? ####<meld>neutral
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over. ####<meld>neutral
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um, ####<meld>fear
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs... ####<meld>joy
Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. ####<meld>neutral
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies ####<meld>neutral
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. ####<meld>surprise
Which proves that I never lie. ####<meld>neutral
I guess you don't. ####<meld>neutral
Paolo made a pass at me. ####<meld>sadness
Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out. ####<meld>fear
Im not freaking out. ####<meld>neutral
Why would I be freaking out? ####<meld>neutral
A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. ####<meld>neutral
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! ####<meld>anger
I mean, whats the harm in that? ####<meld>neutral
Right here! ####<meld>sadness
Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel ####<meld>anger
Phoebe and Rachel! ####<meld>anger
So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way! ####<meld>sadness
It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt. ####<meld>sadness
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>joy
Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready ####<meld>neutral
I know! I know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you. ####<meld>anger
Hey, did she buy it? ####<meld>neutral
Totally. ####<meld>neutral
So did Heldi show you the place? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, its beautiful. ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you! ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay look, I have an idea. ####<meld>neutral
Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. ####<meld>neutral
And then whoever does gets the phone. ####<meld>neutral
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide. ####<meld>sadness
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin. ####<meld>sadness
Did I use that already today? Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I win! Hes got ####<meld>joy
So you dont know thats ####<meld>neutral
His new girlfriend! ####<meld>surprise
I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. ####<meld>sadness
Shes saving the rest for her divorce. ####<meld>anger
And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to ####<meld>neutral
Well what happened at dinner? ####<meld>neutral
My parents spent the money for our wedding! ####<meld>anger
My God! What did you order?! ####<meld>surprise
Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center! ####<meld>sadness
Honey, its gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies! ####<meld>sadness
No, yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Its gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. ####<meld>neutral
Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. ####<meld>neutral
Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me. ####<meld>neutral
I will sit with you Dr. Geller. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. ####<meld>neutral
Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division. ####<meld>sadness
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" ####<meld>fear
Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. ####<meld>neutral
Im Ross! ####<meld>joy
Im divorced, and I have a kid! ####<meld>joy
Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs! ####<meld>joy
Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me. ####<meld>anger
All right, there you go! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy! ####<meld>anger
Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, good-good for you. ####<meld>joy
Im Rhonda,  and these arent real! ####<meld>neutral
Wow, Rhonda. ####<meld>surprise
Im Scott. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, okay, Scott! ####<meld>neutral
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die. ####<meld>fear
So thanks for the warm welcome. ####<meld>neutral
Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. ####<meld>joy
I hope you do too. ####<meld>neutral
Now, lets go out there and get em! ####<meld>joy
And remember, there is no I in team. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody ####<meld>joy
You! Chuckles! Whats your name? ####<meld>neutral
Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah... ####<meld>fear
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. ####<meld>neutral
I like funny. ####<meld>joy
This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun. ####<meld>joy
Good to have you aboard Bing! ####<meld>joy
Yeah. You won't be able to take it. ####<meld>neutral
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her? ####<meld>neutral
They're gonna call her Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think? ####<meld>neutral
Works on you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that is so sweet. ####<meld>joy
No, no, ok, you hang up. ####<meld>joy
Ok, ok, one, two, three. ####<meld>joy
Well you didn't hang up either. ####<meld>joy

You're over me? ####<meld>surprise
Ohhhhhhhh God. ####<meld>surprise
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me? ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, ohh. ####<meld>sadness
When, when were you... under me? ####<meld>surprise
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. ####<meld>neutral
OK, I need to lie down. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition! ####<meld>joy
Really? That's great! ####<meld>joy
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her ####<meld>joy
(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, ####<meld>joy
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. ####<meld>joy
Ben is way cuter than that kid. ####<meld>joy
I mean look at him, look at you, ####<meld>disgust
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad? ####<meld>neutral
Joey, you look nothing like Ben. ####<meld>neutral
I look more like him than you do! ####<meld>anger
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that. ####<meld>joy
That really was some of your best work. ####<meld>joy
Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work. ####<meld>neutral
I have to be up in seven minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Do you wanna? ####<meld>neutral
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish! ####<meld>joy
Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back. ####<meld>neutral
Boyfriend? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Im Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Kristen. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again? ####<meld>joy
Kristen. ####<meld>neutral
Got it!  So ####<meld>neutral
So uh, do you live around here? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Right down there. ####<meld>neutral
Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip. ####<meld>neutral
Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone. ####<meld>joy
Ill remember that. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Oh I, I have plans tonight. ####<meld>neutral
But how about tomorrow? ####<meld>neutral
Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? ####<meld>joy
You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, um... ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
: Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' ####<meld>neutral
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you! ####<meld>sadness
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work. ####<meld>neutral
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her? ####<meld>neutral
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me. ####<meld>anger
You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over. ####<meld>sadness
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hello liar. ####<meld>anger
Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike. ####<meld>sadness
I couldve been killed I hope you know! ####<meld>anger
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were ####<meld>sadness
Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
What?!  What the hell?! ####<meld>anger
All right, yknow what? ####<meld>anger
If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back. ####<meld>anger
What?! Why?! ####<meld>surprise
Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar ####<meld>anger
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. ####<meld>anger
Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy. ####<meld>joy
Okay Ross!  Please dont die! ####<meld>anger
How could you have kept all of this from me? ####<meld>fear
I was going to tell you, but ####<meld>neutral
But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel! ####<meld>anger
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that? ####<meld>anger
Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it. ####<meld>neutral
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down. ####<meld>neutral
Everything on your application looks really goodOhh! ####<meld>joy
Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out? ####<meld>anger
Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay? ####<meld>joy
You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here. ####<meld>joy
Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it. ####<meld>sadness
Why did you take the shower curtain down? ####<meld>surprise
That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious. ####<meld>fear
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey man, how did the audition go? ####<meld>neutral
Estelle said I didn't get it. ####<meld>sadness
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me. ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>surprise
For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around. ####<meld>neutral
No, from now on, Im staying in one place. ####<meld>neutral
Right here. ####<meld>neutral
Well, its getting late. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, were gonna go. ####<meld>neutral
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while? ####<meld>neutral
Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, its a very large plane. ####<meld>neutral
Thats cool. ####<meld>neutral
But, well stay here with you. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt. ####<meld>joy
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood. ####<meld>surprise
Theyre not a couple! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-okay, I get the game now. ####<meld>neutral
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
Well okay, so then youre fine. ####<meld>neutral
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. ####<meld>neutral
Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Noooo!! ####<meld>neutral
Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye. ####<meld>neutral
Wait a second! So, whats new with you? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week. ####<meld>neutral
And your breasts! Hmm!!! ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Umm look, youre coming on a little strong. ####<meld>fear
But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. ####<meld>neutral
So, why dont we just start over okay? ####<meld>neutral
And you can just tell me about yourself. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I write erotic novels, for children. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Theyre wildly unpopular. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>disgust
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! You do? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah,  a Pretty Huge ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>disgust
So, uh, how's she doing? ####<meld>sadness
The doctor says it's a matter of hours. ####<meld>sadness
How-how are you, Mom? ####<meld>sadness
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair? ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
What's different? ####<meld>surprise
Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, maybe that's it. ####<meld>neutral
She is unbelievable, our mother is... ####<meld>anger
Okay, relax, relax. ####<meld>neutral
We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God! ####<meld>surprise
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
...Yeah, they were gross. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, you know what I loved? ####<meld>joy
Her Sweet 'n' Los. ####<meld>joy
How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants. ####<meld>joy
Not just restaurants, from our house. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe. ####<meld>neutral
You can't! ####<meld>surprise
Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said. ####<meld>surprise
In the hall. ####<meld>neutral
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. ####<meld>neutral
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. ####<meld>neutral
Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys. ####<meld>neutral
That's a good one! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Dad, Ronni's here. ####<meld>neutral
Huh? ####<meld>surprise
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. ####<meld>neutral
Anything at all. ####<meld>neutral
But these are the three that Monica pre-approved. ####<meld>neutral
Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest. ####<meld>joy
