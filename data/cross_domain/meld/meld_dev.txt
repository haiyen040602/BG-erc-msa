Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head? ####<meld>anger
Hands. ####<meld>neutral
Hands! ####<meld>neutral
It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. ####<meld>neutral
Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years! ####<meld>neutral
Hes in room 816. ####<meld>neutral
816, thank you! ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
And what is his name? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned. ####<meld>neutral
Awww. ####<meld>joy
Thanks a million. ####<meld>joy
Oh, youre welcome a million. ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ill see you in our room. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa! What?! Why?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie. ####<meld>sadness
Here?! Now?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff. ####<meld>fear
What happened? ####<meld>surprise
Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago. ####<meld>sadness
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky! ####<meld>joy
Stupid, useless Canadian money! ####<meld>anger
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Will you call him? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! ####<meld>joy
I will! ####<meld>joy
Absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! That is so good! ####<meld>joy
Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
What do you got there? ####<meld>neutral
Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some? ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Huh? Uh ####<meld>neutral
Dude! Dude! ####<meld>surprise
Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why? ####<meld>neutral
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00. ####<meld>surprise
What?! Tonight?! ####<meld>surprise
Thats what Monica said. ####<meld>neutral
After she gave me that big speech?! ####<meld>surprise
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? ####<meld>anger
I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy! ####<meld>anger
Okay, is this lamp in the same place? ####<meld>neutral
Who cares? I repel women. ####<meld>disgust
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked. ####<meld>surprise
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Its yours! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah well, Im-Im a slut. ####<meld>sadness
Me too. ####<meld>neutral
Hi Jill! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi . ####<meld>neutral
Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not! ####<meld>joy
Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight. ####<meld>neutral
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it! ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, man. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, y'know what you should do? ####<meld>neutral
You should make something happen for yourself. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, like-like write a play. ####<meld>neutral
Write a movie! ####<meld>joy
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, what about those ####<meld>neutral
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it? ####<meld>sadness
Wait a second, I could star in it! ####<meld>joy
Or that. ####<meld>neutral
I can't write! ####<meld>anger
Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? ####<meld>sadness
I can't do it. ####<meld>sadness
I'll help you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. ####<meld>neutral
And plus, it'll give me something to do. ####<meld>neutral
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. ####<meld>neutral
Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star. ####<meld>neutral
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do. ####<meld>neutral
Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize. ####<meld>neutral
I would really love it if I could do both. ####<meld>neutral
All right, II have to ask. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>neutral
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again? ####<meld>fear
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained? ####<meld>anger
A hundred and forty-five pounds. ####<meld>disgust
Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?! ####<meld>anger
Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me? ####<meld>joy
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her. ####<meld>anger
Frannie was the one who found your ####<meld>neutral
That bitch! ####<meld>anger
Monica! What ####<meld>surprise
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?! ####<meld>anger
Hi Frannie, congratulations. ####<meld>neutral
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! ####<meld>anger
Why?! ####<meld>surprise
WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding? ####<meld>anger
What could I have possibly done?! ####<meld>anger
Stuart! ####<meld>anger
I believe you know my husband. ####<meld>neutral
So its really a question of ####<meld>neutral
Hey ladies! What are you in here for? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
Gary, I'm here to report a crime. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together. ####<meld>neutral
What's up? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. ####<meld>neutral
Man to uh, me. ####<meld>neutral
Sure. Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy. ####<meld>neutral
You mean scared. ####<meld>neutral
No, I mean happy. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff. ####<meld>joy
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in. ####<meld>sadness
What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right? ####<meld>surprise
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Over a stupid room! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here! ####<meld>joy
Oh no, yeah no, that parts great! ####<meld>joy
Shut-out!! ####<meld>surprise
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game! ####<meld>surprise
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning! ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, get out! ####<meld>anger
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! ####<meld>anger
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? ####<meld>anger
Come on, wussies! ####<meld>anger
All right, ok, I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
I'm going,  and I'm gone. ####<meld>neutral
One more game? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Ohhh. Dont go. ####<meld>sadness
No, I-I-I gotta go. ####<meld>sadness
No. No! No! No! ####<meld>sadness
Honey, honey, people are looking. ####<meld>sadness
I dont care!  I dont care!! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now. ####<meld>sadness
You cant leave! I have your shoe! ####<meld>sadness
Good-bye Chandler Bing. ####<meld>sadness
Rachel has those in burgendy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, ew! ####<meld>disgust
What? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. ####<meld>neutral
Um, can you roll your tongue? ####<meld>neutral
Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad. ####<meld>neutral
What, wait, you mean like this? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. ####<meld>surprise
Your not doing it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that.... ####<meld>neutral
Where there is no fear of commitment. ####<meld>neutral
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. ####<meld>neutral
But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. ####<meld>neutral
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! ####<meld>fear
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. ####<meld>neutral
Right. ####<meld>neutral
In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was. ####<meld>neutral
Amazingly, that makes sense. ####<meld>joy
You think? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way. ####<meld>fear
Hey!  Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center. ####<meld>joy
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating? ####<meld>joy
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. ####<meld>neutral
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts! ####<meld>surprise
Im missin picture time?! ####<meld>joy
Yknow she has a face Ross! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us. ####<meld>joy
Wow! ####<meld>joy
That is a good one! ####<meld>joy
Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. ####<meld>neutral
Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together? ####<meld>neutral
Together? Like-like to people? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay? ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later? ####<meld>neutral
Uh sure, sure. ####<meld>neutral
Bye guys. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore. ####<meld>anger
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend? ####<meld>anger
Is this about Mark? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, its not, its not. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break. ####<meld>sadness
Fine, youre right. ####<meld>neutral
Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. ####<meld>neutral
No. A break from us. ####<meld>sadness
Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock. ####<meld>joy
Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work. ####<meld>joy
Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then. ####<meld>neutral
Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either. ####<meld>neutral
Oh? Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament. ####<meld>neutral
Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something? ####<meld>anger
Well now-now youre just talking crazy. ####<meld>joy
So why cant the three of us go out together? ####<meld>neutral
Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me. ####<meld>sadness
Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. ####<meld>sadness
And the way she looked at me, pure lust. ####<meld>joy
Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya? ####<meld>anger
Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. ####<meld>neutral
Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club. ####<meld>joy
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch. ####<meld>anger
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. ####<meld>neutral
It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep. ####<meld>neutral
: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon! ####<meld>anger
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom. ####<meld>neutral
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over. ####<meld>neutral
Did he call? ####<meld>neutral
No. Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called? ####<meld>sadness
Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women. ####<meld>neutral
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why? ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss. ####<meld>neutral
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward? ####<meld>surprise
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you? ####<meld>anger
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that. ####<meld>anger
And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry? ####<meld>sadness
I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion! ####<meld>anger
Is that too much to ask after six years?! ####<meld>anger
I mean what? ####<meld>anger
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! ####<meld>anger
I mean do we not have as much fun?! ####<meld>anger
Dont I deserve a few tears?!! ####<meld>sadness
I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out! ####<meld>sadness
Hey! ####<meld>anger
I did not cry my eyes out!! ####<meld>anger
Come on! ####<meld>sadness
Its like the end of an era! ####<meld>sadness
No more J-man and Channies! ####<meld>sadness
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?! ####<meld>anger
Do I know why were rushing? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? ####<meld>neutral
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I found it! ####<meld>joy
Thats so great for you guys! ####<meld>joy
Good luck, with your girlfriend. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!! ####<meld>joy
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time. ####<meld>neutral
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, you can, very much. ####<meld>joy
Ahhhh!! ####<meld>surprise
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table! ####<meld>joy
Do ####<meld>neutral
Ah, ####<meld>neutral
Do ####<meld>neutral
Ah, ####<meld>neutral
DO YOU? ####<meld>anger
Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, come on. ####<meld>disgust
Hey! ####<meld>sadness
All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! ####<meld>joy
And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. ####<meld>neutral
And what you said about Nana. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. ####<meld>sadness
And you know what? ####<meld>neutral
I think she was. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it? ####<meld>surprise
You forget how many great songs Heart had. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard. ####<meld>neutral
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it. ####<meld>neutral
What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey. ####<meld>neutral
And monkeys cant write out prescriptions. ####<meld>neutral
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke. ####<meld>anger
Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars. ####<meld>neutral
I cant find garbage bags! ####<meld>anger
Oh, I think I saw some in here. ####<meld>neutral
What is it?! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die. ####<meld>disgust
I cant believe were living here! ####<meld>sadness
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really  proposing? ####<meld>surprise
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out. ####<meld>anger
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?! ####<meld>surprise
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it. ####<meld>anger
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out. ####<meld>sadness
Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, look, just do it gently. ####<meld>neutral
You’re right. ####<meld>neutral
You’re right. ####<meld>neutral
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle. ####<meld>neutral
I can do that. ####<meld>neutral
I am a gentle person. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, by the  way. ####<meld>neutral
Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. ####<meld>sadness
Which ####<meld>neutral
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else? ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which ####<meld>joy
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here ####<meld>joy
You completely stole my answer! ####<meld>anger
Well, honey that was pretty obvious. ####<meld>sadness
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it! ####<meld>anger
What do you think? You in the blue shirt. ####<meld>neutral
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers. ####<meld>neutral
Would ya care to venture one? ####<meld>neutral
Would ####<meld>neutral
Are you just repeating what I'm saying? ####<meld>anger
All right, let's move on. ####<meld>neutral
Okay then. ####<meld>neutral
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. ####<meld>neutral
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. ####<meld>neutral
You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill be uh, Mr. Wong. ####<meld>neutral
Diverse. ####<meld>neutral
Did anybody call for security? ####<meld>neutral
You be cool. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey? ####<meld>neutral
Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it? ####<meld>fear
Way to be cool, man. ####<meld>neutral
Whats he talking about? ####<meld>neutral
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone! ####<meld>anger
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring? ####<meld>surprise
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess! ####<meld>anger
Okay, who are you? ####<meld>surprise
The Hardy boys? ####<meld>anger
Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right? ####<meld>anger
I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that? ####<meld>anger
Marry me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Joey! ####<meld>surprise
Hell yeah! Ill marry you! ####<meld>joy
You cant marry him! ####<meld>anger
Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe! ####<meld>surprise
Why?! Why cant she marry me?! ####<meld>surprise
I can and I will! ####<meld>anger
Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months! ####<meld>anger
Its Joey! ####<meld>surprise
Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father? ####<meld>surprise
We dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh I wonder if that dude. ####<meld>neutral
Theres a dude? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Who? Who is it? ####<meld>surprise
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but ####<meld>disgust
Was that story over? ####<meld>neutral
The guy left this. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! I know who the father is ####<meld>surprise
People have got to finish their stories! ####<meld>anger
Oh my God, youre back! ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! ####<meld>surprise
Why do you want to see my hand? ####<meld>neutral
I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash. ####<meld>disgust
Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out. ####<meld>disgust
No! ####<meld>anger
Me too! ####<meld>joy
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look stupid! ####<meld>joy
Alright were back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! ####<meld>joy
Three, Two, One! ####<meld>neutral
Cut! ####<meld>neutral
No! Year! Happy No Year! ####<meld>joy
Okay, heres where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone thats a wrap! ####<meld>joy
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no-no believe me, Im leaving as soon as possible! ####<meld>neutral
Good. Good. Not that we dont want you to stay, obviously youre welcomeHow much more homework do you have? ####<meld>neutral
I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>surprise
No, she doesnt. ####<meld>neutral
Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits. ####<meld>neutral
They are completely differentOkay! ####<meld>anger
Okay! ####<meld>surprise
Okay! ####<meld>surprise
I didnt make it! ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry! ####<meld>sadness
I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that were supposed to ####<meld>neutral
Oh, its okay. I dont ####<meld>neutral
No-no, its not okay! ####<meld>sadness
Its not! ####<meld>sadness
I mean you were just Youre so incredible! ####<meld>sadness
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! ####<meld>sadness
Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you! ####<meld>joy
I will! ####<meld>sadness
I-I am going to ####<meld>neutral
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. ####<meld>neutral
No.  And then I called him, and he wasnt there. ####<meld>neutral
Well, then hes, hes probably just, out. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over. ####<meld>neutral
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Its me. ####<meld>sadness
Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called. ####<meld>joy
Really? Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont, dont you think we can work on this? ####<meld>sadness
Hey, what do you want to drink? ####<meld>neutral
Whos that? ####<meld>surprise
Nobody. ####<meld>neutral
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice? ####<meld>neutral
Is that Mark? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, honey, look he just came over to.... ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Got it! ####<meld>anger
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, thats okay, thanks. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay? ####<meld>sadness
Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers. ####<meld>neutral
You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable. ####<meld>neutral
Sure. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan? ####<meld>surprise
If this is your idea of sexy talk? ####<meld>surprise
No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them? ####<meld>fear
What contracts? ####<meld>neutral
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I dont get. ####<meld>joy
Like what? ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? ####<meld>disgust
Tag! ####<meld>anger
Im serious! ####<meld>anger
This isnt funny! ####<meld>anger
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today! ####<meld>anger
Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts! ####<meld>surprise
Yes I did! And I put a little ####<meld>anger
Im telling you, you never gave them to me. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk. ####<meld>anger
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are ####<meld>anger
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch! ####<meld>disgust
You wanna go down to the office right now? ####<meld>neutral
No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office. ####<meld>anger
Okay I understand.  I wouldnt want to be proved wrong either. ####<meld>neutral

Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler. ####<meld>joy
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? ####<meld>neutral
Oh right, Coach Ruben. ####<meld>neutral
Do you know what Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. ####<meld>fear
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. ####<meld>neutral
See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense. ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean? ####<meld>surprise
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week! ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here! ####<meld>anger

Whoo-hoo! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, there you go! ####<meld>joy
Second date! ####<meld>joy

Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? ####<meld>anger
I mean,... how needy is that? ####<meld>disgust
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon? ####<meld>neutral
You're so pretty. ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today. ####<meld>neutral

The charity's on fire! ####<meld>fear
Help! ####<meld>fear
Oh good! ####<meld>joy
Thank you, I need that. ####<meld>joy
Whoa! ####<meld>surprise
What is that?! ####<meld>surprise
It's nine o'clock in the morning! ####<meld>surprise
Can I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall? ####<meld>neutral
Hes not here right now. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, youre kidding me! ####<meld>anger
All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Im an actor. Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, there are two people who could put your picture up there. ####<meld>neutral
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  Youre the other one right? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on. ####<meld>sadness
What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make! ####<meld>surprise
Theres nothing sexual about this? ####<meld>anger
Oo God! ####<meld>sadness
What are you looking at?! ####<meld>anger
I mean hi. ####<meld>neutral
Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again! ####<meld>fear
No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages! ####<meld>sadness
No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do! ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it. ####<meld>neutral
Are you sure? ####<meld>surprise
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
I guess. ####<meld>neutral
Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked? ####<meld>joy
Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, were done. ####<meld>neutral
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? ####<meld>surprise
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools? ####<meld>joy
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Sweet! ####<meld>joy
All right, well finish your coffee; lets go. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough. ####<meld>disgust
Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight. ####<meld>neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party? ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby ####<meld>sadness
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think? ####<meld>neutral
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding. ####<meld>neutral
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding! ####<meld>joy
Oh, what a fun office. ####<meld>joy
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. ####<meld>neutral
So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back? ####<meld>neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Peach pit. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, Bunny? ####<meld>neutral
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had- ####<meld>neutral
-Peaches? ####<meld>neutral
Actually, nectarines, but basically... ####<meld>neutral
Could've been a peach. ####<meld>neutral
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. ####<meld>joy
All right! ####<meld>joy
Westminster Abbey! ####<meld>joy
Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place. ####<meld>neutral
Really? To what? ####<meld>surprise
To Put the Camera Away!!! ####<meld>anger
Man, ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, theres a guy right over there. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a mailman! Thats ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy! ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that? ####<meld>neutral
Eh..., I dont, I dont know. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>neutral
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing? ####<meld>sadness
Rachel? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new? ####<meld>joy
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever. ####<meld>neutral
Eh, do you believe that? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby. ####<meld>anger
No, you said the baby creeps you out. ####<meld>neutral
No, the little girl creeps me out. ####<meld>anger
You said the baby. ####<meld>neutral
Why would the baby creep me out? ####<meld>anger
Why would the little girl creep you out? ####<meld>anger
You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower? ####<meld>neutral
This is going in your book? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great! ####<meld>joy
What?! Excuse me! ####<meld>surprise
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. ####<meld>neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I made it! ####<meld>joy
Im on time! ####<meld>joy
Okay, why dont we all uh,  open our books to page 23. ####<meld>neutral
Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots. ####<meld>neutral
Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right? ####<meld>anger
Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? ####<meld>neutral
What the? What ####<meld>surprise
Miss? May I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? ####<meld>fear
But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. ####<meld>neutral
So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? ####<meld>neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you? ####<meld>neutral
Of course not. ####<meld>neutral
I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. ####<meld>joy
I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Of course! ####<meld>neutral
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me. ####<meld>joy
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit ####<meld>neutral
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is ####<meld>anger
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy! ####<meld>disgust
Ooh, it's not a toy. ####<meld>anger
Well, I don't know what else to do. ####<meld>sadness
I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! ####<meld>anger
So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! ####<meld>anger
'Cause I-I got nothing! ####<meld>anger
All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. ####<meld>anger
Okay then. ####<meld>neutral
Here we go. ####<meld>neutral
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? ####<meld>neutral
Ask again later. ####<meld>neutral
Later is not good enough. ####<meld>anger
Ask again later. ####<meld>neutral
What the hell! ####<meld>anger
This is broken! ####<meld>anger
It-it is broken! ####<meld>anger
All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan. ####<meld>joy
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so... ####<meld>neutral
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts. ####<meld>joy
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team. ####<meld>anger
Come on, two on one. ####<meld>neutral
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! ####<meld>surprise
What, now? ####<meld>surprise
Yes, now is when you swoop! ####<meld>joy
You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! ####<meld>joy
You're like, like the anti-Paolo! ####<meld>anger
My Catholic friend is right. ####<meld>neutral
She's distraught. ####<meld>neutral
You're there for her. ####<meld>neutral
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! ####<meld>joy
Well, I just called Joshua ####<meld>neutral
Oh, how did it go? ####<meld>sadness
Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time. ####<meld>neutral
What did he say? ####<meld>neutral
Well uh, his answering machine was ####<meld>sadness
Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care. ####<meld>sadness
I dont think hes the one Im sad about. ####<meld>sadness
Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, maybe. ####<meld>sadness
And I-I am just trying to figure out why. ####<meld>sadness
Any luck? ####<meld>sadness
Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? ####<meld>sadness
I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again. ####<meld>sadness
Again. Yknow what? I think we all did. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! ####<meld>joy
I dont get it! ####<meld>surprise
It was in my room all night! ####<meld>anger
And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did? ####<meld>anger
Shh! ####<meld>anger
Were trying to think! ####<meld>anger
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
I got in there myself once. ####<meld>neutral
My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin. ####<meld>neutral
No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit. ####<meld>anger
All right, you have yourself a deal. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  See?! I told ya! ####<meld>surprise
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!! ####<meld>anger
Hey! Whats up? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!! ####<meld>joy
Hey Joey! ####<meld>joy
Erin! Still here! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time! ####<meld>joy
Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks! ####<meld>joy
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head. ####<meld>anger
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Ohh! ####<meld>surprise
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
I mean you definitely should do that. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what, I should do it. ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool. ####<meld>joy
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head! ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing. ####<meld>sadness
This woman's living my life. ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! ####<meld>anger
Look at this, look. ####<meld>anger
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. ####<meld>anger
She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. ####<meld>anger
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. ####<meld>anger
You're not an artist. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't. ####<meld>anger
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty. ####<meld>surprise
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is. ####<meld>anger
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope! ####<meld>fear
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that is so sick. ####<meld>disgust
I feel violated. And not in a good way. ####<meld>disgust
How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots! ####<meld>surprise
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around? ####<meld>joy
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long. ####<meld>neutral
I know. My arm is killing me. ####<meld>neutral
No, I meant with the dropper over here. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm ####<meld>anger
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK. ####<meld>sadness
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box. ####<meld>sadness
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here. ####<meld>neutral
Whats the matter? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
What is it? Hey! ####<meld>sadness
Really its nothing. Im just ####<meld>sadness
Rach come on, what? ####<meld>neutral
Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone. ####<meld>sadness
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross? ####<meld>surprise
Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, how long was I watching that woman? ####<meld>neutral
Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I guess so. ####<meld>neutral
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh? ####<meld>sadness
Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?! ####<meld>surprise
I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand! ####<meld>joy
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six. ####<meld>anger
We said seven! ####<meld>anger
We said six! ####<meld>anger
The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!" ####<meld>anger
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Oh my good God. ####<meld>disgust
I know what time you said. ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said. ####<meld>neutral
You, get out of my shop! ####<meld>anger
Well, what did he do? ####<meld>surprise
He went out with my wife! ####<meld>anger
Joey! ####<meld>surprise
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did ####<meld>anger
Thats my wife!!! Get out! ####<meld>anger
Well, we should go. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport. ####<meld>neutral
Oh please. ####<meld>neutral
Every moment is precious. ####<meld>sadness
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving. ####<meld>sadness
Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then. ####<meld>neutral
On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane. ####<meld>sadness
No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, and I was saying the actual words. ####<meld>neutral
So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed. ####<meld>neutral
We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot. ####<meld>neutral
Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love. ####<meld>joy
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Just go for it Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, you should. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, you should, really. ####<meld>neutral
All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys. ####<meld>neutral
: Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me. ####<meld>sadness
Come on Treeger, dont say that. ####<meld>sadness
You just ahh, you just need more practice. ####<meld>neutral
Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again. ####<meld>neutral
Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. ####<meld>sadness
I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
: Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like ####<meld>neutral
July. Umm, ####<meld>neutral
Thats really beautiful. What does it mean? ####<meld>joy
Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much. ####<meld>neutral
Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it. ####<meld>sadness
I-I do though. ####<meld>sadness
I do too. ####<meld>sadness
Bye Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you! ####<meld>joy
I cant believe youre getting married! ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Monica and Rachel made out. ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh! ####<meld>surprise
Why are we in bed together? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
No! ####<meld>neutral
But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we? ####<meld>fear
I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot. ####<meld>joy
And we didnt have sex. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid. ####<meld>neutral
Tell me about it. ####<meld>neutral
What are we gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
I say we go with ####<meld>neutral
Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us? ####<meld>neutral
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here? ####<meld>sadness
Whats that smell? ####<meld>disgust
I know! ####<meld>anger
Hi, remember us? ####<meld>neutral
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a ####<meld>neutral
I am. I'm ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? It ####<meld>neutral
Sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Im so exited! ####<meld>joy
Ive been waiting for this for months! ####<meld>joy
I got my hair coloured! ####<meld>joy
I got new sheets! ####<meld>joy
Im making him a ####<meld>joy
What am I making him by the way? ####<meld>neutral
Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup. ####<meld>neutral
I thought I was making him filet mignon? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. ####<meld>neutral
And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke. ####<meld>anger
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook. ####<meld>surprise
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it! ####<meld>sadness
Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated. ####<meld>fear
Yknow its like uh, Biology! ####<meld>neutral
Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. ####<meld>fear
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe! ####<meld>joy
If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay. ####<meld>neutral
You are falling fast asleep. ####<meld>neutral
Deeper. ####<meld>neutral
Deeper. ####<meld>neutral
Deeper. ####<meld>neutral
You are now completely asleep. ####<meld>neutral
You dont need to smoke. ####<meld>neutral
Cigarettes dont control you. ####<meld>neutral
You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. ####<meld>neutral
A strong, confident woman. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller. ####<meld>neutral
Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up. ####<meld>joy
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre? ####<meld>neutral
Of course not. ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else. ####<meld>neutral
So how are things going with Paul? ####<meld>neutral
Good. ####<meld>joy
Although yknow, he-hes a private guy. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings. ####<meld>sadness
Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open. ####<meld>neutral
So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table? ####<meld>surprise
No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone. ####<meld>neutral
Hi honey. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident. ####<meld>fear
Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?! ####<meld>surprise
You said number two. ####<meld>neutral
I also said number one. ####<meld>neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular. ####<meld>neutral
Cant I just look at the handles on them? ####<meld>neutral
You would think. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, fine. ####<meld>neutral
Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress? ####<meld>anger
Because, I dont care. ####<meld>neutral
I dont care. ####<meld>neutral
I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do. ####<meld>anger
So I dont think I should do it anymore. ####<meld>sadness
Im gonna give you my weeks notice. ####<meld>sadness
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Gunther, I quit. ####<meld>sadness
Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee? ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, I mean its just so realistic! ####<meld>joy
I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat. ####<meld>neutral
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! ####<meld>joy
Do you uh, do youready for a refill? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining! ####<meld>surprise
Pretty cool, huh? ####<meld>joy
But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, can I use your bathroom? ####<meld>neutral
Its uh, right through there. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment ####<meld>joy
Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it? ####<meld>joy
You know, I think I was sixteen. ####<meld>neutral
Please, just a little bit off the back. ####<meld>neutral
I'm still on "no." ####<meld>neutral
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec? ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again. ####<meld>anger
What's goin' on? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night. ####<meld>neutral
What stupid thing did you do? ####<meld>neutral
Ewww! ####<meld>disgust
I know. ####<meld>neutral
See, yes. ####<meld>neutral
Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick. ####<meld>neutral
I love you both. ####<meld>neutral
But in very different ways. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out? ####<meld>anger
If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine! ####<meld>anger
Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too. ####<meld>fear
Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals! ####<meld>disgust
Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man. ####<meld>disgust
Thanks, Im glad you see it that way. ####<meld>joy
Ohhh-hoo, funny story! ####<meld>joy
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him. ####<meld>neutral
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet. ####<meld>neutral
I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had! ####<meld>joy
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that? ####<meld>surprise
I might've said that.  Why is that funny? ####<meld>neutral
Because I'm very happy for him!  And ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>sadness
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? ####<meld>anger
Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out! ####<meld>disgust
Fish! ####<meld>surprise
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here ####<meld>sadness
Oh, it's so much more fun with you. ####<meld>joy
We did have fun, didn't we? ####<meld>joy
We did! ####<meld>joy
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I would love to! ####<meld>joy
Yay, okay! ####<meld>joy
Good, good, good, good, good. ####<meld>joy
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop. ####<meld>neutral
Um...  Done! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, its coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee! ####<meld>surprise
Its-its hot ####<meld>neutral
Hot coffee!!! ####<meld>surprise
You idiot!! ####<meld>anger
You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! ####<meld>anger
What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! ####<meld>anger
Huh? ####<meld>anger
Whats your favourite thing about summertime? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer? ####<meld>joy
Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, thats a good one. ####<meld>joy
OK, try this salmon mousse. ####<meld>neutral
Mmmm. Good. ####<meld>joy
Is it better than the other salmon mousse? ####<meld>neutral
It's creamier. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, is that ####<meld>neutral
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know? ####<meld>disgust
My God! What happened to you? ####<meld>surprise
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? ####<meld>disgust
"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation." ####<meld>anger
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that! ####<meld>joy
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really ####<meld>anger
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt! ####<meld>sadness
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up. ####<meld>joy
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you. ####<meld>neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice! ####<meld>sadness
Sweetie, you think you can get in there? ####<meld>neutral
I don't see why not. ####<meld>neutral
Here's my retainer! ####<meld>neutral
Someone in there? ####<meld>neutral
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die. ####<meld>anger
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high? ####<meld>surprise
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name. ####<meld>neutral
Ginger. ####<meld>neutral
Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so.... ####<meld>neutral
Dont you have to use the bathroom? ####<meld>neutral
Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I do. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. ####<meld>neutral
Someone in here. ####<meld>neutral
Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it! ####<meld>anger
Oh yes there is! ####<meld>anger
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?! ####<meld>anger
Oh, my baby! ####<meld>sadness
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, just years of experience. ####<meld>neutral
Can I get some ice here?! ####<meld>sadness
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are. ####<meld>joy
Youre not the fan whos dying are you? ####<meld>neutral
No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma! ####<meld>joy
Oh that was a real person?! ####<meld>surprise
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me ####<meld>neutral
I-I-Im leaving the show? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know. Why? Did you hear something? ####<meld>neutral
Who told you that? ####<meld>surprise
Oh uh, one of the writers. ####<meld>sadness
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall? ####<meld>surprise
Feel better? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Much! ####<meld>joy
Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I understand. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere? ####<meld>surprise
I dont think so. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on ####<meld>joy
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
$4.50 please. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, let me get this.    These are for you. ####<meld>neutral
Alright, alright, alright. ####<meld>neutral
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. ####<meld>anger
Oh God, do something. ####<meld>anger
Just make contact, smile! ####<meld>anger
There you go! ####<meld>joy
You're definitely scaring here. ####<meld>neutral
Would you like to call somebody? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not on this desk. ####<meld>anger
Oh ####<meld>neutral
Its my sister. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the ####<meld>neutral
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon? ####<meld>anger
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well maybe not on those levels. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Im never gonna find a roommate, ever. ####<meld>sadness
Why, nobody good? ####<meld>neutral
Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural. ####<meld>disgust
The spitter. ####<meld>disgust
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. ####<meld>anger
Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing ####<meld>neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow? ####<meld>neutral
Two. ####<meld>neutral
This photographer, who seemed really dull. ####<meld>neutral
And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message. ####<meld>neutral
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more! ####<meld>neutral
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices. ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>neutral
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo... ####<meld>neutral
Umm, hows it going with you guys? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
What-what are-what are these? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think? ####<meld>joy
No-no-no, no! ####<meld>fear
Well, how-how come? ####<meld>neutral
Thats just the way it is. ####<meld>neutral
Thats crazy. ####<meld>surprise
Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. ####<meld>neutral
See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter! ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Peter! ####<meld>neutral
Its me Rhonda! ####<meld>neutral
From PS-129! ####<meld>neutral
I shared my puddin which you man! ####<meld>anger
I gave you my ####<meld>neutral
I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he ####<meld>neutral
Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you later, Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Op, this is saved.  Gift shop. ####<meld>neutral
Hows that coffee comin, dear? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan. ####<meld>neutral
Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy. ####<meld>neutral
I know! ####<meld>joy
Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh? ####<meld>surprise
Op. ####<meld>neutral
Eh. ####<meld>joy
Oh, you got me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion. ####<meld>neutral
How does that sound? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that sounds great. ####<meld>joy
Come on over here, sweetheart. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much. ####<meld>joy
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together? ####<meld>fear
No. But thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it? ####<meld>sadness
Okay. No. But thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, that was kinda brutal. ####<meld>surprise
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. ####<meld>neutral
Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow. ####<meld>neutral
Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, ####<meld>neutral
Wow. ####<meld>surprise
I'm, I'm really sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved. ####<meld>neutral
Relieved? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, ####<meld>anger
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Fine! ####<meld>anger
But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility! ####<meld>anger
...I can begin to trust you again. ####<meld>anger
Does that seem like something you can do. ####<meld>anger
Does it?! ####<meld>anger
No? ####<meld>surprise
Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I know. ####<meld>sadness
I mean, no, youre right. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah I guess Ill let it go. ####<meld>neutral
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this. ####<meld>sadness
Sure, its hard to forget! ####<meld>neutral
But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it! ####<meld>neutral
A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about. ####<meld>neutral
What the hell happened on that beach?! ####<meld>surprise
Its between us and the sea, Ross! ####<meld>neutral
I didnt think you were gay. I do now. ####<meld>joy
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, by the way, that is her full name. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow! Im free for her! ####<meld>joy
Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow? ####<meld>neutral
Hold on, yknow I ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure! ####<meld>joy
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont really know what that is, but ####<meld>neutral
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay. ####<meld>disgust
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital. ####<meld>surprise
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, get out of the fridge. ####<meld>anger
All right, all right. ####<meld>anger
What is that? ####<meld>surprise
For the ride. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, like in a cab... ####<meld>neutral

Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality. ####<meld>joy
Yes. Absolutely. A quality. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this. ####<meld>neutral
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! ####<meld>surprise
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome. ####<meld>joy
Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana. ####<meld>sadness
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday. ####<meld>joy
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce. ####<meld>neutral

You know it? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, sure, they love us over there. ####<meld>neutral
Ben! Ben! Ben! ####<meld>joy
How about Joey... Pepponi? ####<meld>neutral
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. ####<meld>neutral
Joey... Switzerland? ####<meld>neutral
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. ####<meld>neutral
Which I'm not. ####<meld>neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin? ####<meld>neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar. ####<meld>neutral
Well, it does not ring a bell with me... ####<meld>neutral
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. ####<meld>joy
Might wanna try Joseph. ####<meld>neutral
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! ####<meld>joy
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. ####<meld>joy
Are you kidding? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, look. ####<meld>neutral
I-I studied evolution. ####<meld>joy
Remember, evolution? ####<meld>joy
Monkey into man? ####<meld>anger
Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. ####<meld>neutral
Im Doctor Monkey! ####<meld>anger
Im not arguing with that. ####<meld>neutral
All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision. ####<meld>neutral
You are both idiots. ####<meld>disgust
The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! ####<meld>disgust
You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! ####<meld>anger
Now let it go! ####<meld>anger
The joke sucks! ####<meld>anger
Its your joke. ####<meld>neutral
Is not. ####<meld>anger
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all. ####<meld>joy
I didnt! ####<meld>joy
Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. ####<meld>joy
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! ####<meld>surprise

Then don't touch one!! ####<meld>anger
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Thanks! ####<meld>joy
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character. ####<meld>neutral
Done! ####<meld>joy
And it can't be Joey. ####<meld>neutral
It's not. ####<meld>neutral
Or Joseph. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out. ####<meld>joy

Okay. ####<meld>neutral

Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Where've you been? ####<meld>neutral
At the vet. ####<meld>neutral
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? ####<meld>fear
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! He beat ya. ####<meld>joy
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. ####<meld>sadness
So what does this mean? ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna have to give him up. ####<meld>sadness
Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again! ####<meld>anger
Hang on buddy! ####<meld>anger
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this? ####<meld>surprise
I sure did. ####<meld>neutral
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. ####<meld>surprise
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? ####<meld>joy
May I come in? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, yeah, if you want too. ####<meld>neutral
Do ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, sure? ####<meld>neutral
So do I. ####<meld>neutral
Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. ####<meld>neutral
This is just about tonight. ####<meld>neutral
I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." ####<meld>neutral
I just want this to be  about what it is! ####<meld>joy
And um, what-what is that Ross? ####<meld>neutral
The physical act of love. ####<meld>joy
What?! Are you crazy? ####<meld>surprise
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness? ####<meld>surprise
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh! ####<meld>surprise
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness. ####<meld>joy
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?! ####<meld>anger
No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no. ####<meld>joy
Ah Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Joey Tribbiani. ####<meld>neutral
Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island. ####<meld>neutral
So, does that mean the audition is off? ####<meld>sadness
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands! ####<meld>neutral

Wow! Fortunately she has a ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places! ####<meld>surprise
Hi there. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options. ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! ####<meld>neutral
So, keep having sex on a regular basis. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, DAMN IT! ####<meld>anger
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor. ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking- ####<meld>neutral
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know. ####<meld>anger
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! C'mon! ####<meld>joy
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey- ####<meld>neutral
Hi, is uh, is Carol here? ####<meld>neutral
No, she's at a faculty meeting. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... ####<meld>neutral
Come in. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum. ####<meld>neutral
What's it look like? ####<meld>neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. ####<meld>neutral
Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. ####<meld>surprise
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic. ####<meld>joy
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. ####<meld>neutral
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy? ####<meld>surprise
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there? ####<meld>joy
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it? ####<meld>surprise
I have no idea what you just said. ####<meld>neutral
Put Joey on the phone. ####<meld>neutral
What's up man? ####<meld>neutral
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind. ####<meld>neutral
and that was all before 10 oclock. ####<meld>neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. ####<meld>neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay? ####<meld>surprise
Well, up yours too! ####<meld>anger
Wheres Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh! ####<meld>surprise
Joey? Joey Tribbiani? ####<meld>neutral
Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats. ####<meld>neutral
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of. ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down there? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again? ####<meld>anger
Yeah! You wanna come? ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Fine. ####<meld>neutral
Fine. ####<meld>neutral
Fine. ####<meld>neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Whats the matter? ####<meld>sadness
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!! ####<meld>disgust
Oh Willies still alive! ####<meld>surprise
What are you guys doing? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us. ####<meld>joy
Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist. ####<meld>neutral
Thats not true, there are great pictures of us! ####<meld>surprise
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the ####<meld>surprise
I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, heres a great one. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Im not in that. ####<meld>neutral
I know, but look at me: all tan. ####<meld>joy
Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow ####<meld>joy
Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so stupid. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler what do you say? ####<meld>neutral
All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going. ####<meld>neutral
Gimme them! ####<meld>anger
No! They are mine! ####<meld>anger
You stole them from me! ####<meld>anger
You stole them from me!! ####<meld>anger
Gimme them! ####<meld>anger
You just wanna each take one? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do? ####<meld>anger
Well ####<meld>neutral
Why don’t you phase it out? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening! ####<meld>neutral
They’re not listening too me? ####<meld>surprise
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you. ####<meld>neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing? ####<meld>neutral
I think you look fine. ####<meld>neutral
