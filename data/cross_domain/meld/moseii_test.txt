Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me! ####<meld>anger
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi! ####<meld>anger
Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom? ####<meld>neutral
Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A ####<meld>anger
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers. ####<meld>sadness
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple? ####<meld>joy
Okay, youre fine. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?! ####<meld>surprise
Youll see. ####<meld>neutral
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen. ####<meld>joy
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles ####<meld>neutral
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go. ####<meld>neutral
But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time. ####<meld>neutral
Really, its fine, whatever you want. ####<meld>neutral
Its perfect. ####<meld>joy
And, I dont know, if it starts to rain ####<meld>joy
Well then well get wet. ####<meld>anger
Ohh. And I dont even have a date. ####<meld>sadness
Coming. ####<meld>neutral
I have a bone to pick with you. ####<meld>anger
Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear
Yes! Ben learned a little trick. ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old ####<meld>surprise
Thats right! Thats right! ####<meld>joy
Oh that. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them! ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true! ####<meld>anger
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
And if it were true, how ####<meld>neutral
Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go. ####<meld>neutral
Mark's a genius! ####<meld>surprise
Why?! How?! How is he a genius? ####<meld>surprise
Look, don't you see what's happening here. ####<meld>anger
Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. ####<meld>anger
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you. ####<meld>neutral
What am I going to do? ####<meld>fear
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. ####<meld>neutral
All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits. ####<meld>neutral
I don't know you guys. ####<meld>fear
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. ####<meld>disgust
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' ####<meld>disgust
And before you know it, she's with him. ####<meld>anger
And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' ####<meld>anger
And he'll be all, 'Yes!' ####<meld>anger
And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' ####<meld>joy
And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' ####<meld>disgust
And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' ####<meld>disgust
He paints quite a picture doesn't he? ####<meld>neutral
This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor. ####<meld>neutral
Great. Great. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud. ####<meld>neutral
Ill be there. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes! ####<meld>neutral
Okay! Well need a six-pack of ####<meld>neutral
Hey guys, what are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, come on! ####<meld>sadness
Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there. ####<meld>neutral
And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot. ####<meld>neutral
What do ya say? What do ya say? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. ####<meld>neutral
But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk. ####<meld>neutral
I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid! ####<meld>sadness
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. ####<meld>sadness
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! ####<meld>surprise
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... ####<meld>joy
What's that supposed to mean? ####<meld>surprise
Nothing! It's an expression. ####<meld>neutral
No it's not. ####<meld>neutral
Don't listen to your mother. ####<meld>neutral
You're independent, and you always have been! ####<meld>neutral
Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! ####<meld>neutral
And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... ####<meld>neutral
PBS Telethon. ####<meld>neutral
Hi Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
I ####<meld>neutral
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not ####<meld>anger
What kind of problem? ####<meld>surprise
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag! ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway! ####<meld>sadness
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag. ####<meld>sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag. ####<meld>sadness
I don't have to give up the bag! ####<meld>anger
Do I Rach? ####<meld>sadness
Oh, you think I should give up the bag! ####<meld>anger
Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it ####<meld>neutral
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag. ####<meld>sadness
I can't believe I'm hearing this! ####<meld>sadness
Wait a minute! ####<meld>sadness
Wait a minute! ####<meld>anger
I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah umm, they're called wallets. ####<meld>neutral
I think you'll find this room more to your liking. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, great. ####<meld>joy
They say he's only got half a tank left. ####<meld>neutral
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do! ####<meld>surprise
We're switching rooms again. ####<meld>anger
What? Why? ####<meld>surprise
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room. ####<meld>anger
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you. ####<meld>joy
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second? ####<meld>anger
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! ####<meld>neutral
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!! ####<meld>anger
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!! ####<meld>anger
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you? ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I wouldnt miss this. ####<meld>joy
Well, Im very glad youre here. ####<meld>joy
Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey. ####<meld>neutral
So are guys doing okay? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important. ####<meld>neutral
Do you have a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah, sure, whats up? ####<meld>neutral
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys. ####<meld>neutral
Oh really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, did you not want people to know that? ####<meld>joy
But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay. ####<meld>joy
Whys that? ####<meld>neutral
I dont think I should say. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Kay. ####<meld>neutral
Well ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, shes gay. ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Great! All right, so Ill call you later. ####<meld>joy
Great! ####<meld>joy
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that? ####<meld>surprise
That would be Casey. Were going out tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer. ####<meld>surprise
No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! ####<meld>anger
Wait! Youre going out with Kathy! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset? ####<meld>surprise
Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. ####<meld>disgust
What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive. ####<meld>sadness
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. ####<meld>anger
But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you. ####<meld>neutral
You got all that from the back of her head? ####<meld>surprise
All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane. ####<meld>neutral
Whos Elaine? ####<meld>neutral
Can you people not see me?! ####<meld>joy
So, will you talk to him? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free ####<meld>anger
One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back! ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? ####<meld>neutral
We need a porn break. ####<meld>neutral
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again. ####<meld>neutral
Well, so, why dont you just turn it off? ####<meld>joy
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Well, what-what cha got there? ####<meld>joy
Oh this, well Im glad you asked. ####<meld>joy
Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? ####<meld>disgust
Ahh! ####<meld>neutral
Now, I know what youre thinking ####<meld>neutral
Pregnant Woman Slays Four? ####<meld>fear
Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they? ####<meld>surprise
No! ####<meld>joy
Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan. ####<meld>neutral
Whats the second part of your plan? ####<meld>neutral
Yes thats right. ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>surprise
I tired attacking two women, did not work. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends. ####<meld>neutral
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them. ####<meld>anger
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?! ####<meld>anger
Oh, no! ####<meld>surprise
No-no! ####<meld>surprise
No, I tired! ####<meld>surprise
But I couldnt. ####<meld>neutral
Thats why Im here. ####<meld>anger
Maybe we could attack them together? ####<meld>neutral
That-thats a no. ####<meld>neutral
What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross! ####<meld>sadness
Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross! ####<meld>anger
I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game! ####<meld>anger
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you. ####<meld>anger
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything. ####<meld>neutral
No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain. ####<meld>neutral
I like that. ####<meld>joy
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. ####<meld>neutral
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
One swift kick and hell back off. ####<meld>neutral
All right, bad ankle, got it! ####<meld>neutral
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay! ####<meld>joy
And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp. ####<meld>neutral
But-but, Liams on my team. ####<meld>joy
I dont care! You just get him! ####<meld>anger
Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! ####<meld>joy
The Red Ross! Okay. ####<meld>joy
Oh!  Oh by the way? ####<meld>neutral
Uh-hmm. ####<meld>neutral
James Brolin? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay. ####<meld>neutral
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Hello, is Ross there? ####<meld>neutral
Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try. ####<meld>neutral
Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking! ####<meld>joy
Oh!  Shes growing inside you. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Wow that was a big one. ####<meld>surprise
I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me. ####<meld>joy
Oh hey you guys! ####<meld>joy
Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going? ####<meld>neutral
I have a job interview I have to get ready for. ####<meld>neutral
I thought you already have a job. ####<meld>neutral
And people say you dont pay attention. ####<meld>neutral
No, this is a much better job. ####<meld>neutral
Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! How do you know how to do that?! ####<meld>surprise
Thats what I do now. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey, come taste this. ####<meld>neutral
What is it? ####<meld>neutral
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge! ####<meld>anger
You cooked him? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! ####<meld>joy
"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica." ####<meld>joy
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya? ####<meld>sadness
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet? ####<meld>neutral
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together. ####<meld>disgust
Were never gonna find anybody. ####<meld>sadness
Well then let me do it! ####<meld>joy
Joe ####<meld>joy
No-no-no! ####<meld>neutral
Look, Ive been thinking about it. ####<meld>neutral
Im an actor right? ####<meld>neutral
So I wont get nervous talking in front of people. ####<meld>neutral
I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts! ####<meld>anger
Everyone knows Im an ass man! ####<meld>joy
That is true. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. ####<meld>joy
Itll be me! ####<meld>joy
And I swear Ill do a really good job. ####<meld>joy
Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me. ####<meld>joy
It might be kinda cool. ####<meld>joy
So I can do it? ####<meld>joy
Ah-ha! Too cocky! ####<meld>joy
I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours. ####<meld>fear
Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place. ####<meld>neutral
What the hell is that? ####<meld>anger
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing? ####<meld>surprise
You said there was a gas leak in here. ####<meld>neutral
Well why dont you use your key? ####<meld>neutral
Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded. ####<meld>neutral
If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. ####<meld>neutral
Come on! ####<meld>anger
Hurry up. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! We could have done that. ####<meld>neutral
Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Im so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Um, and maybe Im wrong! ####<meld>sadness
I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more. ####<meld>neutral
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him? ####<meld>surprise
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, but its made her so happy. ####<meld>anger
Little girl misses her cat. ####<meld>neutral
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
I ####<meld>neutral
He is right, isnt he? ####<meld>joy
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong. ####<meld>neutral
You think? ####<meld>surprise
Oh-no, hes right. ####<meld>neutral
Seven hundred bucks! ####<meld>joy
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? ####<meld>joy
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. ####<meld>joy
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing? ####<meld>neutral
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? ####<meld>disgust
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know those are a delicacy in India. ####<meld>neutral
Me too. ####<meld>neutral
Although this city is my home, so. ####<meld>neutral
So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, you make something up. ####<meld>neutral
Nice,  thank you. ####<meld>joy
This is me. ####<meld>neutral
Here. ####<meld>neutral
Your eyes are very pretty. ####<meld>joy
Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you! ####<meld>joy
He would like to kiss you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no!! ####<meld>joy
Not him, you dont! ####<meld>surprise
Well the moments over. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oy! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice? ####<meld>anger
Id really prefer a mountain bike. ####<meld>neutral
Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. ####<meld>surprise
Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum. ####<meld>anger
Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, you want something serious. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. ####<meld>neutral
Those are dead serious. ####<meld>neutral
All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever. ####<meld>anger
No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant. ####<meld>fear
Why not?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is... ####<meld>neutral
What is the thing? ####<meld>sadness
Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
They were in his office. ####<meld>neutral
Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me. ####<meld>sadness
Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk. ####<meld>anger
Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready? ####<meld>joy
How are you feeling? ####<meld>neutral
You are ####<meld>neutral
I really wish that you wouldnt. ####<meld>anger
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? ####<meld>neutral
Then we can put you in bed, okay? ####<meld>neutral
Just smile and dont talk to ####<meld>neutral
Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh? ####<meld>joy
Pheebs!! ####<meld>joy
Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet! ####<meld>joy
Speech! Come on Monica! ####<meld>joy
Come on! ####<meld>joy
Come on! Speech! ####<meld>joy
Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second! ####<meld>anger
Oh-ho, I think its nice. ####<meld>joy
Well you have to because maybe its stupid. ####<meld>neutral
Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with. ####<meld>joy
Oh crap! ####<meld>anger
All right. ####<meld>neutral
The super couldnt figure out what it did. ####<meld>neutral
A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did. ####<meld>sadness
Ive had seven pretty serious shocks. ####<meld>sadness
I officially give up. ####<meld>disgust
Thank God. ####<meld>joy
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing. ####<meld>joy
See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it. ####<meld>anger
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two? ####<meld>sadness
He doesn't have anyone. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible. ####<meld>anger
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! ####<meld>joy
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. ####<meld>neutral
You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. ####<meld>neutral
No way, forget it. ####<meld>joy
C'mon, she's your mom! ####<meld>anger
Exactly. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! ####<meld>joy
I love her books! ####<meld>joy
I cannot get on a plane without one! ####<meld>joy
I mean, this is so cool! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.' ####<meld>disgust
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast. ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
And a nice hot cider for Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser? ####<meld>surprise
Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry! ####<meld>surprise
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? ####<meld>neutral
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree! ####<meld>anger
Yeah I can, it worked real well. ####<meld>neutral
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again. ####<meld>anger
I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette. ####<meld>anger
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em. ####<meld>anger
Who are you talking too? ####<meld>surprise
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree. ####<meld>disgust
I am ####<meld>neutral
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!! ####<meld>anger
I-I'm sorry! Sorry. ####<meld>fear
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup! ####<meld>neutral
Shh! Get me out of here. ####<meld>fear
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Come here, check this out! ####<meld>surprise
What? Is it the comet? ####<meld>neutral
No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here. ####<meld>surprise
Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, theres ####<meld>neutral
Show me where? ####<meld>neutral
Right-right up here. ####<meld>neutral
Joey wheres the pipe that was holding the door open? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know!   Yeah, I do. ####<meld>joy
Joey! ####<meld>anger
What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid ####<meld>anger
Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! ####<meld>anger
Oh no! No! No! ####<meld>surprise
Wow! This place is incredible!  Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
Im Trudie. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
You must be Bens mum. ####<meld>neutral
Why else would I be here? ####<meld>neutral
Do sit down. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hi.. how was the game? ####<meld>neutral
Well.. ####<meld>neutral
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! ####<meld>joy
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? ####<meld>surprise
Alan. ####<meld>neutral
He was unbelievable. ####<meld>joy
He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-... ####<meld>joy
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. ####<meld>joy
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. ####<meld>joy
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
..I dunno, a little too Alan? ####<meld>neutral
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. ####<meld>joy
I personally could have a gallon of Alan. ####<meld>joy
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade, ####<meld>joy
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself? ####<meld>fear
What the hell! ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, this was a stupid idea. ####<meld>disgust
My God! ####<meld>surprise
These pants are burning up! ####<meld>surprise
Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! ####<meld>surprise
What is she trying to kill me? ####<meld>anger
It's like a volcano in here! ####<meld>surprise
Are you hot? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, it must just be me then. ####<meld>neutral
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom? ####<meld>neutral
You're driving me crazy with that! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I'll stop. ####<meld>neutral
Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot! ####<meld>anger
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now. ####<meld>anger
You wanna play? ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. ####<meld>neutral
And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule. ####<meld>neutral
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home. ####<meld>neutral
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch? ####<meld>joy
I'm intrigued. ####<meld>neutral
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts. ####<meld>joy
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle? ####<meld>neutral
Uh yeah, right here. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? ####<meld>joy
What's that? ####<meld>neutral
Weeeell, it's rum, and- ####<meld>neutral
I'm sure they'll be here soon. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this. ####<meld>neutral
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station. ####<meld>neutral
You are really frightening me. ####<meld>fear
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple? ####<meld>fear
All right, ten centimeters, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
All right, honey, time to start pushing. ####<meld>neutral
But they're not here yet! ####<meld>fear
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, god. ####<meld>fear
Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you. ####<meld>joy
And I mean-Im having a lot of fun. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun. ####<meld>neutral
Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right? ####<meld>joy
So where-where is it going? ####<meld>neutral
Ah! ####<meld>surprise
Thats-thats the real question. ####<meld>neutral
And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun. ####<meld>joy
Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger. ####<meld>neutral
No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou ####<meld>fear
Im sorry, so umm, so where are we? ####<meld>sadness
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. ####<meld>joy
I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . ####<meld>joy
No? ####<meld>anger
Really? ####<meld>surprise
They taste so good. ####<meld>joy
Drum roll. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John? ####<meld>neutral
Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney. ####<meld>neutral
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse. ####<meld>neutral
Youre actually going through with this? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. ####<meld>anger
Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson. ####<meld>neutral
You got problems because of you! ####<meld>anger
Not your name! ####<meld>sadness
All right, this has got to stop! ####<meld>anger
Chandler is a great name! ####<meld>anger
In factyes,  Im, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell! ####<meld>surprise
It was. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me. ####<meld>sadness
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa. That was really good. ####<meld>surprise
Thanks, any suggestions? ####<meld>neutral
You-youyou had sex with Ursula?! ####<meld>surprise
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and ####<meld>fear
You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?! ####<meld>surprise
Well I was just so excited to see you. ####<meld>sadness
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird. ####<meld>disgust
No-no its not! ####<meld>sadness
I dont want to lose you! ####<meld>fear
Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird. ####<meld>sadness
So I guess this is it. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, so do you. ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross? ####<meld>neutral
Manhattan does not have enough stores. ####<meld>sadness
Well, ####<meld>neutral
You can? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Um-hmm. ####<meld>neutral
And a small piece of chocolate. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship ####<meld>sadness
I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be! ####<meld>fear
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon. ####<meld>joy
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time. ####<meld>sadness
I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas! ####<meld>disgust
Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris? ####<meld>surprise
No! No! Not, Paris. ####<meld>neutral
Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona? ####<meld>joy
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen! ####<meld>anger
When? ####<meld>anger
I dont know exactly. ####<meld>neutral
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes. ####<meld>sadness
But I do know that its some time tomorrow. ####<meld>joy
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him! ####<meld>joy
Great! Go get him. ####<meld>joy
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first. ####<meld>neutral
Hes not really my type. ####<meld>neutral
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything. ####<meld>neutral
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks. ####<meld>sadness
You do attract some stinkers. ####<meld>sadness
Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a ####<meld>neutral
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, listen. ####<meld>neutral
If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. ####<meld>neutral
Really. ####<meld>joy
Nothing at all. ####<meld>neutral
Really. ####<meld>joy
Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine? ####<meld>neutral
Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one? ####<meld>sadness
No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, I keep trying, yknow? ####<meld>anger
I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom." ####<meld>sadness
He may think Im sick. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with! ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them. ####<meld>neutral
Thats it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time? ####<meld>joy
Pretty much. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Monica! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey man, you feeling any better? ####<meld>neutral
Joey, we have something to tell you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Youre pregnant! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas. ####<meld>neutral
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!Eh! Well ####<meld>surprise
You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn. ####<meld>disgust
Hes gonna go up to the counter with ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I missed this. ####<meld>joy
Me too. ####<meld>anger
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww! ####<meld>joy
Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help. ####<meld>anger
We will. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles. ####<meld>neutral
No Mon, ####<meld>neutral
Every year. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Ross! ####<meld>joy
Die Hard ####<meld>neutral
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature? ####<meld>neutral
Whatd you rent? ####<meld>neutral
Die Hard 2 ####<meld>neutral
Joey, this is ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its ####<meld>neutral
Joey, we ####<meld>neutral
And? ####<meld>neutral
And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Die Hard ####<meld>neutral
Dude, you didnt say ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans. ####<meld>neutral
Well, John McClane had plans! ####<meld>anger
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch. ####<meld>neutral
What are you talking about? Bitch. ####<meld>anger
I know you botched that operation on purpose. ####<meld>joy
I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. ####<meld>anger
I don't care if you    are my brother. ####<meld>disgust
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch! ####<meld>joy
Stop going through my stuff ! ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. ####<meld>anger
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea. ####<meld>fear
Please, what about you and Chandler? ####<meld>anger
That's different! I was drunk and stupid! ####<meld>anger
Well hello ! ####<meld>anger
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them? ####<meld>neutral
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey! ####<meld>anger
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna do it. ####<meld>joy
And I can't stop you. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? ####<meld>neutral
I'm smarter than ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up. ####<meld>joy
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man. ####<meld>neutral
Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there. ####<meld>joy
No. ####<meld>neutral
No, thank you. ####<meld>neutral
You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there. ####<meld>neutral
Id love an ice water. ####<meld>neutral
You got it. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, what are you doing? ####<meld>surprise
Just being friendly. ####<meld>anger
Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there. ####<meld>anger
Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther? ####<meld>neutral
Dont wink at me. And put on your apron. ####<meld>anger
Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons. ####<meld>sadness
Joey, do you work here? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, waiter. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. ####<meld>neutral
Im calling for Monica Geller. ####<meld>neutral
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available ####<meld>neutral
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!! ####<meld>surprise
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever! ####<meld>anger
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am ####<meld>neutral
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again. ####<meld>sadness
So go fix it! ####<meld>neutral
Go find Chandler! ####<meld>neutral
He's probably up in your room! ####<meld>sadness
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him. ####<meld>anger
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one! ####<meld>joy
Anybody lose this? ####<meld>neutral
Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! ####<meld>joy
Hmm. ####<meld>neutral
Do you remember where the duck food is? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why? ####<meld>surprise
Because Im going to London. ####<meld>neutral
What?! What do you mean youre going to London? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. ####<meld>neutral
Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back. ####<meld>neutral
IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily! ####<meld>fear
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. ####<meld>fear
But I have to tell him how I feel! ####<meld>sadness
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision. ####<meld>neutral
Thats not why youre going! ####<meld>sadness
Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. ####<meld>sadness
Forget that British chippy." ####<meld>sadness
OhhDo you think he will?! ####<meld>surprise
No! ####<meld>sadness
Because hes in love with the British chippy! ####<meld>sadness
Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, its too late! ####<meld>anger
You missed youre chance! ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over. ####<meld>sadness
Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do." ####<meld>anger
I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter. ####<meld>joy
So is everybody here? ####<meld>neutral
I got here a little early myself. ####<meld>neutral
Let us begin. ####<meld>neutral
Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. ####<meld>neutral
Here. ####<meld>neutral
Here. ####<meld>neutral
Now as for the hydrosaurs ####<meld>neutral
Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. ####<meld>neutral
Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
So, do you think you can forgive me? ####<meld>sadness
Great. ####<meld>joy
Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Okay, bye. ####<meld>neutral
Hello, Jennifer? ####<meld>neutral
Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, shes not home huh? ####<meld>surprise
Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Are you all right? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh… I think I just got engaged. ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! He did it? ####<meld>surprise
Well…did you know he was gonna ask me? ####<meld>joy
Are you kidding? ####<meld>surprise
I’m like the one who talked him into it. ####<meld>joy
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group. ####<meld>sadness
And you really think this is a good idea? ####<meld>sadness
I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people. ####<meld>neutral
I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right. ####<meld>sadness
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so. ####<meld>surprise
Really?! Even Ross? ####<meld>surprise
Especially Ross! ####<meld>joy
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back. ####<meld>surprise
There he goes, your fiancée. ####<meld>joy
I guess so. ####<meld>neutral
Although he does play with himself in his sleep. ####<meld>neutral
I can’t say that I’m surprised. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that is so unfortunate. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>neutral
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight. ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone. ####<meld>neutral
You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out. ####<meld>joy
Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore. ####<meld>neutral
I think on some levels she already knows. ####<meld>neutral
Night Mon. Night Julio. ####<meld>neutral
Adiós. ####<meld>neutral
Look Julio, someone left their book here. ####<meld>surprise
Ah actually, that is mine. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, what are you reading? ####<meld>neutral
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it? ####<meld>neutral
Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it? ####<meld>neutral
I thought I would, but the translation's no good. ####<meld>neutral
Your a poet and don't know it. ####<meld>neutral
Actually I ah, I am a poet. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about? ####<meld>neutral
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip. ####<meld>neutral
Mine?  Right here? ####<meld>neutral
I can write an epic poem about this lip. ####<meld>joy
How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. ####<meld>joy
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Are we really in Montreal?! ####<meld>surprise
Yes we are. So, coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, heres batch 22. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers. ####<meld>anger
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg. ####<meld>neutral
Lets give it a shot. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale? ####<meld>surprise
No, just a Friday night. ####<meld>neutral
Would she? ####<meld>neutral
Would she?  You ate my candy bar! ####<meld>anger
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it. ####<meld>disgust
I know honey, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in. ####<meld>sadness
Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy! ####<meld>joy
Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt.... ####<meld>sadness
I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom. ####<meld>disgust
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you? ####<meld>anger
Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... ####<meld>fear
Its not funny, this is actually my job. ####<meld>anger
Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here. ####<meld>joy
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger. ####<meld>joy
Ah, just one other thing. ####<meld>neutral
Yes?! ####<meld>joy
I ah, I work at ####<meld>neutral
Do you want my pickle? ####<meld>neutral
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news? ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>surprise
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. ####<meld>neutral
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma. ####<meld>joy
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool. ####<meld>anger
We should do something. Whistle. ####<meld>joy
We are not going to whistle. ####<meld>anger
Come on, do it. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Do it! ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>anger
Do it do it do it! ####<meld>joy
Woo-woo! ####<meld>joy
I can't believe you did that! ####<meld>surprise
Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros. ####<meld>neutral
Still? ####<meld>surprise
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance. ####<meld>neutral
I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again. ####<meld>joy
Either eat it, or be in it. ####<meld>anger
Spoon?  So, what do you think? ####<meld>joy
Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. ####<meld>disgust
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in. ####<meld>joy
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? ####<meld>neutral
I can. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, go ahead. ####<meld>neutral
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon. ####<meld>neutral
Thats very good, whats your name? ####<meld>neutral
Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, you go to the head of the class. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>joy
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen. ####<meld>neutral
But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen. ####<meld>neutral
Human spleeeen. ####<meld>neutral
Olé! ####<meld>joy
What are you doing here! ####<meld>surprise
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain! ####<meld>joy
Great! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home". ####<meld>joy
Listen Phoebe... ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but... ####<meld>neutral
But what? ####<meld>neutral
This is kind of a classy place. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, say no more. ####<meld>neutral
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything. ####<meld>sadness
Well, I've brought some books. We could read. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet. ####<meld>joy
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do! ####<meld>joy
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention? ####<meld>neutral
We can't. We're not pharmacists! ####<meld>sadness
I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba... ####<meld>neutral
Kate Miller? ####<meld>neutral
Kate Miller it is. ####<meld>neutral
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend. ####<meld>joy
In that case should I make sure it's on real good? ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
This year was supposed to be great! ####<meld>anger
But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit! ####<meld>disgust
No. No, you're not a loser. ####<meld>sadness
Look at me! ####<meld>anger
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy! ####<meld>joy
Oh, be-because of the leather pants. ####<meld>sadness
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something. ####<meld>joy
That really is something.. that's really cool. ####<meld>joy
Howdy partner! ####<meld>joy
Maybe I should get another pair! ####<meld>joy
Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. ####<meld>joy
I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. ####<meld>joy
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. ####<meld>joy
I would make a good cowboy. ####<meld>joy
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep. ####<meld>neutral
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah! ####<meld>surprise
Great nap. ####<meld>neutral
It really was. ####<meld>neutral
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. ####<meld>joy
So, lets talk about women. Im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?" ####<meld>neutral
Oh, please! ####<meld>disgust
Hey, how you doin? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Mikey ####<meld>neutral
Hey P ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Setting rattraps ####<meld>neutral
To kill Bob?? ####<meld>surprise
No, no, to test his neck strength. ####<meld>neutral
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! ####<meld>anger
I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps. ####<meld>neutral
I'll find Bob, I'll get him. ####<meld>neutral
Bob? ####<meld>fear
Bob! ####<meld>sadness
Robert! ####<meld>anger
Oh wait, I think I hear him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh - Oh my god! ####<meld>surprise
Bob    had babies! ####<meld>surprise
Bob's a mom! ####<meld>surprise
Better think of a new name for him. ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl. ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ... ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god, we killed Bob! ####<meld>sadness
Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse. ####<meld>neutral
Suzie ####<meld>neutral
Hmmm, soup! ####<meld>joy
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, no problem. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. ####<meld>sadness
Joey! ####<meld>surprise
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! ####<meld>anger
So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. ####<meld>anger
I said, "No!" ####<meld>anger
Which puts ####<meld>neutral
Great. So the ball is in his court? ####<meld>anger
Ball? There is no ball. ####<meld>anger
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Why?! ####<meld>surprise
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and ####<meld>neutral
Oh great! That ####<meld>anger
Do-do you, do you have brothers? ####<meld>neutral
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy. ####<meld>neutral
Are you close with them? ####<meld>neutral
No-no, they're not very nice people. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, listen, I really like you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
I think this can go somewhere. ####<meld>neutral
So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us? ####<meld>neutral
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of ####<meld>neutral
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold! ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Its over. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, was it awful? ####<meld>sadness
Well, it was loong. ####<meld>sadness
I didnt even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, she didnt want to stay. ####<meld>sadness
I called a cab. she just left. ####<meld>neutral
I wrote you a letter. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. ####<meld>joy
Its just some things Ive been thinking about. ####<meld>neutral
Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Wow, its-its 5:30 in the morning.  So, Id better get cracking on this baby. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ill be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting. ####<meld>joy
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants! ####<meld>anger
Well, you said that we except the ####<meld>neutral
All right, that Ill retract. ####<meld>neutral
But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it. ####<meld>disgust
Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! ####<meld>disgust
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery. ####<meld>disgust
Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious. ####<meld>anger
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from? ####<meld>surprise
Lebanon. ####<meld>neutral
Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them. ####<meld>anger
How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, then what happened? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn! ####<meld>anger
Hey Pheebs, what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing!   This is not over! ####<meld>anger
No! No! No! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks! ####<meld>sadness
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies? ####<meld>neutral
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it. ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now. ####<meld>sadness
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff. ####<meld>neutral
That's okay, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
All right, let's go Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God! ####<meld>surprise
That was amazing. ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? ####<meld>joy
We may have just started a family. ####<meld>joy
Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby. ####<meld>joy
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye! ####<meld>anger
I knew it! ####<meld>surprise
I knew it! ####<meld>anger
I always knew she liked him! ####<meld>anger
Y'know, shed say no, but here we are! ####<meld>anger
Right? ####<meld>neutral
We just broke up, first thing she does! ####<meld>anger
You didnt just break up. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, its been like three weeks! ####<meld>anger
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower! ####<meld>disgust
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. ####<meld>joy
Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes. ####<meld>neutral
I made a promise that--Oh hey! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
You're nose is bleeding! ####<meld>surprise
Oh God. ####<meld>sadness
No! ####<meld>sadness
Oh not again! ####<meld>anger
This-this happened when my grandfather died. ####<meld>sadness
It's ugh! ####<meld>disgust
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me? ####<meld>neutral
Umm ####<meld>neutral
Sorry. Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either. ####<meld>neutral
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! ####<meld>fear
Hello, Chip. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Rach! How ya doin? ####<meld>joy
Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at ####<meld>joy
So ah, Monica ready yet? ####<meld>neutral
Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch? ####<meld>neutral
Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready? ####<meld>surprise
Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time. ####<meld>joy
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that? ####<meld>surprise
Hes talking to the baby. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! ####<meld>surprise
Okay! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick." ####<meld>surprise
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my, oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Aw, its unbelievable! ####<meld>surprise
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
She is kicking so much! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, shes like ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player? ####<meld>joy
Mia Hamm? ####<meld>neutral
Mia Hamm! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats amazing. ####<meld>joy
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe! ####<meld>surprise
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, what do you guys think? ####<meld>neutral
Dude! ####<meld>surprise
I have never known love like this. ####<meld>sadness
You really like it? ####<meld>surprise
Dude! How-how did you write this? ####<meld>surprise
I stole Monicas and changed the name. ####<meld>neutral
You cant ####<meld>neutral
If he goes first he can! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>anger
Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow thats a great idea! And ####<meld>joy
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. ####<meld>joy
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset. ####<meld>neutral
All the time? ####<meld>sadness
All the time! ####<meld>anger
Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog. ####<meld>neutral
Im all done. ####<meld>neutral
Thank God. ####<meld>joy
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together. ####<meld>neutral
Oh right. ####<meld>neutral
Right. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried? ####<meld>joy
Were probably too old to do that now. ####<meld>sadness
Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles. ####<meld>joy
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related. ####<meld>joy
It took you that long to figure it out, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be. ####<meld>neutral
Relax every muscle in your body. ####<meld>neutral
Listen to the plinky-plunky music. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, tell me your happy place. ####<meld>neutral
Richard's living room, drinking wine. ####<meld>joy
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out! ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place. ####<meld>sadness
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I'll try not to. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky.... ####<meld>neutral
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake? ####<meld>sadness
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees.... ####<meld>joy
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine. ####<meld>sadness
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. ####<meld>joy
And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook.... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee. ####<meld>disgust
OK sweetie, I'll see you later. ####<meld>neutral
See you later Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Bye-bye Julie. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, c'mon, cut it out. ####<meld>joy
Hey? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Can I ask you somethin'? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower. ####<meld>joy
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute? ####<meld>neutral
What's up? ####<meld>neutral
F.Y.I.. ####<meld>neutral
I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. ####<meld>neutral
Her name is Stephanie... something. ####<meld>neutral
She's supposed to be very good. ####<meld>neutral
But what about Phoebe? ####<meld>surprise
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her. ####<meld>sadness
Uh... ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her? ####<meld>fear
Ahh, no. ####<meld>sadness
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Are you jealous? ####<meld>surprise
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. ####<meld>anger
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? ####<meld>anger
You are totally jealous. ####<meld>joy
I'm not jealous. ####<meld>anger
All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. ####<meld>neutral
And y'know, and um, I... ####<meld>neutral
Honey, I love you too. ####<meld>neutral
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
Huh. ####<meld>surprise
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper. ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe you came back. ####<meld>surprise
Dont say anything. ####<meld>joy
I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think. ####<meld>neutral
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now. ####<meld>joy
Rachel! Rachel! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
You missed the exit! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, sorry. ####<meld>neutral
My God, what were you thinking about? ####<meld>surprise
Um,  Barry. ####<meld>neutral
Awwwww ####<meld>joy
I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love! ####<meld>surprise
Dude! ####<meld>joy
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing. ####<meld>joy
God! ####<meld>surprise
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows! ####<meld>joy
Well actually, Ross doesn't. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet. ####<meld>neutral
Dear Mary-Angela. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
How?s it going. ####<meld>neutral
This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write. ####<meld>sadness
What the hell?s a matter with you? ####<meld>disgust
How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter? ####<meld>anger
Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba. ####<meld>neutral
All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. ####<meld>neutral
At least you know her name. ####<meld>neutral
You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy. ####<meld>neutral
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela? ####<meld>fear
Where in Cuba? ####<meld>sadness
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
You uh, you may have been right about Jill. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! I knew it! What happened? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, she kissed me. ####<meld>sadness
What?! You kissed! ####<meld>surprise
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have? ####<meld>neutral
A two and a five. ####<meld>neutral
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars! ####<meld>joy
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got? ####<meld>neutral
A four and a nine. ####<meld>neutral
Youre kidding right? ####<meld>surprise
No. Why? ####<meld>neutral
Well thats a full cup! ####<meld>surprise
Damn! I am good at Cups! ####<meld>joy
What? Why? Where are you? ####<meld>surprise
Im still on the set! ####<meld>neutral
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour! ####<meld>anger
I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister. ####<meld>sadness
No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now. ####<meld>anger
Ugh! Joey, I have to go. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power! ####<meld>anger
Oh hey Joey! What's up? ####<meld>joy
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I've been around. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route? ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. ####<meld>neutral
Great! Problem solved! ####<meld>joy
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance. ####<meld>sadness
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control. ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town. ####<meld>sadness
Bastard! ####<meld>anger
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh! ####<meld>surprise
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp! ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I can't believe it! ####<meld>surprise
I mean I think it's great! ####<meld>joy
For him. ####<meld>neutral
She might be able to do better. ####<meld>neutral
Hey guys! ####<meld>neutral
Joey! Come here! Come here! ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
You mean how they're friends and nothing more? ####<meld>neutral
No. Joey, she ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows? ####<meld>surprise
Yes, but y'know what? ####<meld>neutral
It doesn't matter who knows what. ####<meld>neutral
Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! ####<meld>neutral
Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over! ####<meld>joy
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things. ####<meld>neutral
You really think it would be that different? ####<meld>surprise
How could it not be? ####<meld>surprise
I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. ####<meld>sadness
And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a ####<meld>sadness
Well, things change. ####<meld>neutral
I dont want them to move to a ####<meld>sadness
Itll be okay Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Its still there! ####<meld>surprise
Mrs. Braverman must be out. ####<meld>neutral
She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months. ####<meld>sadness
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake. ####<meld>fear
No that could kill her. ####<meld>fear
Well, we dont want that. ####<meld>neutral
No, so were protecting her. ####<meld>neutral
But we should take it. ####<meld>neutral
But we should move quick. ####<meld>fear
Why? ####<meld>surprise
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there. ####<meld>fear
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! ####<meld>fear
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you're gonna. ####<meld>neutral
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls... ####<meld>neutral
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. ####<meld>neutral
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? ####<meld>sadness
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking... ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you're not him. ####<meld>neutral
You're you. ####<meld>neutral
When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. ####<meld>neutral
Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! ####<meld>neutral
And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married." ####<meld>neutral
You really think so? ####<meld>joy
Yeah. I really do. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks, Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Get off! ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese? ####<meld>neutral
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack? ####<meld>neutral
And the cream? ####<meld>neutral
Cheese makes me thirsty. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Lets move on. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before? ####<meld>surprise
Oh no! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know anything about cooking. ####<meld>neutral
I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles. ####<meld>neutral
Well, hats off to the chef. ####<meld>joy
I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now? ####<meld>neutral
The chef! ####<meld>joy
Thats right. ####<meld>joy
Hey, Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
How's it going? ####<meld>neutral
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys. ####<meld>joy
So what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. ####<meld>neutral
I dunno, there's just something about... ####<meld>neutral
Basically we just feel that he's... ####<meld>neutral
We hate that guy. ####<meld>disgust
Yeah. Hate him. ####<meld>disgust
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out? ####<meld>neutral
...No, we hate him. ####<meld>disgust
We're sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt. ####<meld>neutral
Yes that was mine. ####<meld>fear
Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there. ####<meld>neutral
Yes that would have made more sense. ####<meld>sadness
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! ####<meld>anger
All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. ####<meld>neutral
And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. ####<meld>neutral
Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise? ####<meld>anger
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day? ####<meld>anger
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball. ####<meld>neutral
She said what? ####<meld>surprise
She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it." ####<meld>neutral
Postpone it? ####<meld>joy
Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? ####<meld>anger
Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? ####<meld>anger
This isnt right. ####<meld>neutral
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right. ####<meld>sadness
I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? ####<meld>anger
Dont you point your pants at me! ####<meld>anger
We have no choice! ####<meld>anger
Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand? ####<meld>anger
This is our wedding Im talking about. ####<meld>anger
The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married. ####<meld>neutral
So what are you saying? Its now or never? ####<meld>anger
No. Im saying its now. ####<meld>neutral
Or? ####<meld>anger
Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!! ####<meld>anger
Its not the pants. ####<meld>anger
Its you that is backwards. ####<meld>anger
And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all! ####<meld>anger
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please ####<meld>sadness
Hi, honey. ####<meld>neutral
See you later. ####<meld>neutral
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner! ####<meld>joy
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! ####<meld>anger
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no! ####<meld>surprise
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available ####<meld>neutral
Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!! ####<meld>fear
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! ####<meld>surprise
NOOOO!!!!!!!! ####<meld>anger
Ma! What're you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
I came to give you this  and this. ####<meld>neutral
Oww! Big ring! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. ####<meld>neutral
Do you uh, do you talk about me? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, all the time. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy. ####<meld>neutral
Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge! ####<meld>disgust
Have you ever seen so much crap? ####<meld>disgust
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap ####<meld>anger
Check this out. Can I have this? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. ####<meld>neutral
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. ####<meld>neutral
It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. ####<meld>joy
If it's not you, this is a horrible story. ####<meld>sadness
Fortunately, it is me. ####<meld>joy
And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. ####<meld>joy
Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. ####<meld>joy
Y'know, someplace nice. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, someplace nice. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
How much do you think I can get for my kidney? ####<meld>neutral
So, what do you think? ####<meld>neutral
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen. ####<meld>joy
I know! ####<meld>joy
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads? ####<meld>neutral
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play! ####<meld>joy
Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck! ####<meld>joy
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable. ####<meld>neutral
Gotcha. ####<meld>neutral
This place is really my Grandmothers. ####<meld>neutral
I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. ####<meld>neutral
So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR. ####<meld>neutral
So are you thirsty? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you bet I am! ####<meld>joy
Okay, heres your penis! ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, okay. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house. ####<meld>joy
Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, ready for dinner? ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right? ####<meld>joy
Ooh, I love that place!  So, no. ####<meld>neutral
How about Mama Lisettie's? ####<meld>neutral
Enh. Sure! ####<meld>neutral
I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! ####<meld>neutral
Thatthis milk is mine. ####<meld>neutral
I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, let's go! ####<meld>joy
Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the ####<meld>anger
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?! ####<meld>disgust
Okay, stop! ####<meld>anger
Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever? ####<meld>anger
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Go! ####<meld>neutral
Go! ####<meld>anger
Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose. ####<meld>disgust
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here! ####<meld>sadness
No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink! ####<meld>joy
I know. Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
All right fine! This looks like so much fun. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
God, what a mess. ####<meld>neutral
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I lost. ####<meld>sadness
Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. ####<meld>sadness
Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes. ####<meld>anger
Hey! Howd the interview go? ####<meld>joy
Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. ####<meld>sadness
Thats not how that was supposed to come out. ####<meld>sadness
This is the worst Christmas ever. ####<meld>sadness
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house. ####<meld>neutral
I cant! ####<meld>anger
Its too late! ####<meld>anger
Terry already hired that girl over there. ####<meld>sadness
Look at her, shes even got waitress experience. ####<meld>sadness
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans. ####<meld>sadness
That word was swans. ####<meld>neutral
What do we got there? ####<meld>surprise
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief! ####<meld>surprise
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened. ####<meld>joy
It's all right. ####<meld>neutral
It's all right. ####<meld>neutral
You don't have to explain. ####<meld>neutral
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control. ####<meld>neutral
You're our third call tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year. ####<meld>neutral
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down. ####<meld>sadness
No, you were right. I don't have a plan. ####<meld>neutral
Thank God. Food. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Do you have a plan? ####<meld>neutral
I don't even have a 'pl'. ####<meld>joy
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. ####<meld>sadness
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' ####<meld>surprise
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks? ####<meld>surprise
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? ####<meld>joy
And-and a power tie? ####<meld>joy
Oh God. ####<meld>surprise
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! ####<meld>surprise
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? ####<meld>neutral
Big Bird's friend. ####<meld>neutral
I see pizza! ####<meld>joy
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! ####<meld>joy
Hello? Who are we spying on? ####<meld>sadness
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is? ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>neutral
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker. ####<meld>joy
No, no! ####<meld>disgust
What are you crazy?! ####<meld>disgust
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, its like a law! ####<meld>sadness
Allll done! ####<meld>neutral
Aww, thank you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, whos next?! ####<meld>neutral
No-o-o!  No way! ####<meld>disgust
Come on, please?! Im boredddd! You let me do it once before. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah well, if ah, if thats the rule this weekend...  No! ####<meld>joy

What, like a number? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im done with my choices, these are final. ####<meld>neutral
Well, its about time. ####<meld>anger
Ooh, very official. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer. ####<meld>neutral
And who laminated it? ####<meld>neutral
That would be me. ####<meld>neutral
All right let me see.  Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, its my list. ####<meld>anger
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the ####<meld>neutral
Hi! And you're going into what grade? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early ####<meld>joy
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor. ####<meld>joy
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to ####<meld>joy

Doogie, shh! ####<meld>anger
Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? ####<meld>surprise
Huh? ####<meld>surprise

Ah, Susan will be so pleased. ####<meld>joy
717?  Wheres 717?  Hey, youve have more of these for Susan right? ####<meld>surprise
No. But its okay, Ill just put out pickles or something. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, thank God. ####<meld>joy
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering? ####<meld>surprise
I ate a bug. ####<meld>disgust
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up. ####<meld>joy
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck. ####<meld>fear
Oh, now you want a favour? ####<meld>joy
Yes, please. ####<meld>neutral
Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay? ####<meld>anger
Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends. ####<meld>neutral
No, Im not gonna pick them up. ####<meld>anger
Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk. ####<meld>neutral
So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car. ####<meld>anger
No, Rachel doesnt want me to.... ####<meld>anger
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, youre right. ####<meld>neutral
God, I feel so guilty about Ross. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, I know. ####<meld>sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault. ####<meld>sadness
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened. ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! ####<meld>anger
Well, I think it's very brave what you said. ####<meld>anger
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing? ####<meld>anger
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. ####<meld>anger
Okay, I admit it! ####<meld>anger
I love this coat! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! ####<meld>joy
Remember Phil Huntley? ####<meld>neutral
He was fine! ####<meld>joy
So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man! ####<meld>joy
Oh no ####<meld>fear
Id better go. (She goes and sits down in the ####<meld>neutral
Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail. ####<meld>sadness
I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now shes totally freaked out! ####<meld>anger
Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address? ####<meld>neutral
Rachel! ####<meld>anger
All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear. Ill-Ill-Ill-Ill talk to her. ####<meld>fear
Okay! ####<meld>anger
Okay. ####<meld>neutral

Come on! ####<meld>anger
"We were on a break!" ####<meld>anger
"No we werent!" ####<meld>anger
What happened to you two? ####<meld>surprise
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry. ####<meld>neutral
But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. ####<meld>neutral
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the ####<meld>surprise
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir. ####<meld>neutral
Is this because of the burrito thing? ####<meld>sadness
You need to give him money. ####<meld>neutral
Give him money? It was a joke! ####<meld>surprise
No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off. ####<meld>anger
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money. ####<meld>neutral
You've got to be smooth about it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, I can be smooth. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. ####<meld>neutral
Of course, sir. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Id better get back to my desk. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation. ####<meld>joy
My what? ####<meld>surprise
Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. ####<meld>neutral
But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. ####<meld>neutral
Are you serious? ####<meld>surprise
No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up? ####<meld>neutral
I can blow dry it. ####<meld>neutral
I can put gel on it. ####<meld>neutral
It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. ####<meld>neutral
Its so annoying. ####<meld>disgust
Does it bug you? ####<meld>sadness
You bug me. ####<meld>disgust
Is there any chance you didnt see that? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey, what cha doing? ####<meld>neutral
Sweepin. Why? Turn you on? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney? ####<meld>joy
Joey, did ####<meld>neutral
Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours. ####<meld>joy
Joey,  where did you learn that word? ####<meld>surprise
Where do you think,  Zelda? ####<meld>neutral
You found my book?! ####<meld>anger
Yeah I did! ####<meld>joy
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?! ####<meld>anger
Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn! ####<meld>surprise
Hey-hey, yknow what? ####<meld>anger
Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica. ####<meld>neutral
Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. ####<meld>anger
You got porn! ####<meld>joy
Well, I feel like a snack! ####<meld>joy
Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no thanks. I dont like ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. ####<meld>sadness
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots. ####<meld>neutral
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!! ####<meld>anger
How did you know about that?! ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Come in. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and ####<meld>neutral
Great! ####<meld>joy
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so I made up a little test. ####<meld>neutral
Now, Im gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind. ####<meld>neutral
I can do that. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! Here we go. Pillow. ####<meld>neutral

Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the- ####<meld>disgust
Monica, leave him alone ####<meld>anger
Will you hurry up? ####<meld>sadness
Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?! ####<meld>surprise
And that theyre going to be drinking alot! ####<meld>anger
No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic. ####<meld>neutral
Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster? ####<meld>anger
Joey! ####<meld>anger
Come on! ####<meld>anger
I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright? ####<meld>anger
This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle? ####<meld>fear
So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright? ####<meld>neutral
Oh I am! ####<meld>joy
Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will! ####<meld>anger
Okay, fine! ####<meld>anger
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay. ####<meld>neutral
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute? ####<meld>joy
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny. ####<meld>joy
Okay, now you're even cuter!! ####<meld>joy
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me. ####<meld>surprise
What are you talking about? ####<meld>surprise
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy. ####<meld>joy
That's not possible! ####<meld>joy
Ow! ####<meld>surprise
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way. ####<meld>joy
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough. ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her. ####<meld>sadness
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud! ####<meld>anger
This bicep? ####<meld>surprise
Well it's not flexed right now! ####<meld>anger
It's Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in? ####<meld>sadness
Umm, well, umm Grandma died. ####<meld>sadness
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow. ####<meld>sadness
No you didn't! ####<meld>joy
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not? ####<meld>anger
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. ####<meld>disgust
anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three years. ####<meld>neutral
He was my first client when I became a party planner. ####<meld>neutral
He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well. ####<meld>neutral
And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Oh, thats great! ####<meld>joy
Really? Like how? ####<meld>surprise
Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a good one. ####<meld>joy
Yeah? You like that one? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, youre funny. ####<meld>joy
Im funny? ####<meld>surprise
Oh thank God! ####<meld>joy
Well hey, Ive got a ton of these! ####<meld>joy
Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. ####<meld>neutral
Right? ####<meld>neutral
And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. ####<meld>neutral
And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face. ####<meld>neutral
Can I do it to you? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay? ####<meld>joy
Chloe? Hi.. ####<meld>neutral
Is this about me taking your watch? ####<meld>sadness
You took my watch? ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry, I do that. ####<meld>sadness
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us? ####<meld>sadness
Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. That-that was the problem. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!! ####<meld>joy
Bing! You got those numbers for me? ####<meld>joy
So you still in touch with anyone from high school? ####<meld>neutral
Umm. Well, theres Rachel, and umm, I think thats it. How bout you? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
I see Spindler a lot. ####<meld>neutral
Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. ####<meld>neutral
Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire, J.T., Beardsley. ####<meld>neutral
Is that all? ####<meld>neutral
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, how is he? ####<meld>surprise
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie. ####<meld>neutral
Isnt he an architect now? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, they still wear underwear. ####<meld>neutral
So the Porsche guy took his car back. ####<meld>neutral
But you found the keys to his clothes? ####<meld>neutral
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche. ####<meld>joy
And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Oh! Its you.  Hi. ####<meld>surprise
What about me?! You-you just said I could! ####<meld>anger
Im not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers! ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe youre not picking me. ####<meld>anger
Hey, how can it ####<meld>neutral
Im not even Im not even ####<meld>neutral
Fine, yknow what, thats it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man. ####<meld>anger
Yes!  Shame about you man. ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work. ####<meld>joy
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down. ####<meld>sadness
Wh-what?! Why?! ####<meld>surprise
It's a money thing, we don't have any. ####<meld>sadness
You're kidding right? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, hang out?! How long? ####<meld>sadness
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
A week? ####<meld>anger
Maybe two? ####<meld>neutral
The money will turn up! ####<meld>neutral
People will always wanna invest in movies! ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you're not rich are ya? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Eh, worth a shot.  Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay? ####<meld>neutral
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
These got left for ya. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks.   Congratulations on your big break. ####<meld>sadness
Rachel, do you have any muffins left? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I forget which ones. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
So how was Joan? ####<meld>neutral
I broke up with her. ####<meld>neutral
Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing? ####<meld>surprise
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them. ####<meld>disgust
Come on, they were not that huge. ####<meld>neutral
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain. ####<meld>disgust
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things? ####<meld>surprise
Hold it, hold it. ####<meld>neutral
I gotta side with Chandler on this one. ####<meld>neutral
When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. ####<meld>disgust
It made me nuts. ####<meld>disgust
You or me? ####<meld>neutral
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples. ####<meld>neutral
You guys are messing with me, right? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa." ####<meld>joy
Oh my God, hes lost it. Hes totally lost it. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source. ####<meld>neutral
Youre a genius! ####<meld>joy
Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies! ####<meld>sadness
Now, theres two reasons. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him. ####<meld>neutral
Where?! ####<meld>surprise
On the touchy. ####<meld>neutral
And ####<meld>neutral
No, I know! ####<meld>surprise
I-Im sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one. ####<meld>anger
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I dont wanna get ####<meld>joy
Thank you, Joey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Estelle, listen ####<meld>neutral
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They ####<meld>surprise
What are you talkin about? I never left you! Youve always been my agent! ####<meld>surprise
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Oh well, no harm, no foul. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you guys free tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah!! ####<meld>joy
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime. ####<meld>surprise
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we werewe were just looking around. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars. ####<meld>surprise
What exactly were you looking for, hmm? ####<meld>neutral
Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stocks musings on the Smiledon Californicus? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh. ####<meld>neutral
Ah AhGet out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marions views on evolution? ####<meld>anger
Uh, actually I find Marions views far too progressionist. ####<meld>neutral
I find Marions views far too progressionist. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry, who are you? ####<meld>surprise
Im a professor here uh, RossGeller. ####<meld>neutral
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Its uhWait!  Did you write this? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow, you look nothing like I wouldve thought. Youreyoure so young. ####<meld>surprise
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade. ####<meld>neutral
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. ####<meld>anger
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? ####<meld>anger
The point is I... ####<meld>anger
I don't need this right now, OK. ####<meld>anger
It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. ####<meld>anger
This ship has sailed. ####<meld>anger
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. ####<meld>anger
Fine. ####<meld>anger
Cause I don't need your stupid ship. ####<meld>anger
Good. ####<meld>anger
Good. ####<meld>anger
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something. ####<meld>neutral
All in good time my love. ####<meld>neutral
All in good time. ####<meld>neutral
Oh shoot! ####<meld>surprise
I left my guitar in their apartment. ####<meld>sadness
Well you can let me in later. ####<meld>neutral
I dont have a key, they took mine to give to you. ####<meld>neutral
What?! They took mine to give to you! ####<meld>surprise
Why would they take away our keys? ####<meld>surprise
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff. ####<meld>joy
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all. ####<meld>joy
A ####<meld>neutral
No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, what? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. ####<meld>joy
WhatYoure not serious. ####<meld>surprise
I mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. ####<meld>anger
Shell drive us totally crazy. ####<meld>disgust
Hi Ross! ####<meld>joy
Hi roomie! ####<meld>joy
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know! ####<meld>neutral
Its not like its porn! ####<meld>neutral
This is a serious, legitimate movie. ####<meld>neutral
And the nudity is really important to the story. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what you say about porn. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back. ####<meld>neutral
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on! ####<meld>joy
Well thats true. ####<meld>neutral
And I am only naked in one scene. ####<meld>neutral
Plus it sounds really great. ####<meld>neutral
My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. ####<meld>neutral
Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. ####<meld>neutral
So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. ####<meld>neutral
Its really sweet and-and tender. ####<meld>joy
Hey, whats up? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight. ####<meld>sadness
But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. ####<meld>neutral
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice! ####<meld>joy
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me. ####<meld>neutral
And whats more different than me. A guy whos ####<meld>neutral
So where are we going next? ####<meld>neutral
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home. ####<meld>neutral
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we? ####<meld>fear
Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up? ####<meld>joy
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, no one talks like that! ####<meld>anger
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop! ####<meld>anger
Hey, I'm more cop than you two! ####<meld>anger
How do you figure that? ####<meld>neutral
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner! ####<meld>neutral
I guess so. ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. Thank you! ####<meld>neutral
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one? ####<meld>neutral
Oh what, you-you want both of them? ####<meld>surprise
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?! ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. ####<meld>fear
I know it's in the apartment, but I ####<meld>neutral
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight! ####<meld>fear
Tell her to wear her own earrings. ####<meld>anger
These ####<meld>neutral
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff! ####<meld>anger
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Because I lose her stuff! ####<meld>anger
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Whats going on? ####<meld>neutral
Chandlers gone again! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?! ####<meld>sadness
Okay. You ready to push again? ####<meld>neutral
I already had a baby. Leave me alone. ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it! ####<meld>joy
Yeah!! ####<meld>joy
Little Leslie is here! ####<meld>joy
We got another one! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. ####<meld>surprise
How scary is that? ####<meld>surprise
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on! ####<meld>joy
All right, he's coming. He's coming! ####<meld>joy
Hey, where's his thing? ####<meld>surprise
Chandler's a girl! ####<meld>surprise
Oh God, kindergarten flashback. ####<meld>surprise
They musta read the sonogram wrong. ####<meld>surprise
Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! ####<meld>surprise
Chandler's a girl! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, keep saying it! ####<meld>joy
Am I too late?! ####<meld>neutral
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes. ####<meld>joy
We have our babies? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>joy
Oh, we have our babies. ####<meld>joy
Hey Toby! ####<meld>joy
Hey Bobby. ####<meld>neutral
Its Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler ####<meld>neutral
Uhh yeah. Yeah, its  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why? ####<meld>neutral
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is. ####<meld>anger
Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here. ####<meld>sadness
Toby dont. ####<meld>sadness
Bob! ####<meld>sadness
Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler! ####<meld>anger
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute! ####<meld>joy
I know! I found it on the street. ####<meld>joy
Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Its moving. ####<meld>fear
Ew. ####<meld>disgust
Its stillIts got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!! ####<meld>fear
Ooh! Ah! Okay! ####<meld>fear
Well, I went over to Kyles last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing ####<meld>neutral
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So ####<meld>sadness
Oh just say it Kyle! ####<meld>surprise
Were gonna give it another try. ####<meld>joy
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?! ####<meld>anger
Im gonna work on that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh right, because youre so capable of change. ####<meld>anger
Yknow, he hums when he pees! ####<meld>anger
I do know. ####<meld>neutral
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever. ####<meld>disgust
Were so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Im over it already. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, were gonna go. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Yknow, she ####<meld>sadness
Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we're better off without them. ####<meld>anger
And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let him in your sad mens club! ####<meld>anger
Divorced mens club. ####<meld>sadness
Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche? ####<meld>anger
Maybe because youve got the keys? ####<meld>anger
This is totally your fault! ####<meld>anger
My fault?! You threatened the judge! ####<meld>anger
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Have you seen Chandler?! ####<meld>neutral
No! Why? ####<meld>neutral
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! ####<meld>fear
I know! ####<meld>fear
How bad is this? ####<meld>fear
Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God! ####<meld>fear
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him anywhere! ####<meld>fear
What are you gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure! ####<meld>anger
"Yknow, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?" ####<meld>neutral
Rachel said that! ####<meld>surprise
Well Rachels not here! ####<meld>anger
Come on, come on. ####<meld>neutral
Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. ####<meld>anger
This is all your fault. ####<meld>anger
This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? ####<meld>anger
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you. ####<meld>anger
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. ####<meld>anger
No no no, believe me. ####<meld>anger
No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? ####<meld>anger
And you know what the funny thing is? ####<meld>neutral
When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? ####<meld>anger
Where does that leave me? ####<meld>sadness
You get to be the baby's father. ####<meld>neutral
Everyone knows who you are. ####<meld>neutral
Who am I? ####<meld>anger
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day. ####<meld>sadness
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. ####<meld>neutral
This is so great. ####<meld>joy
You wanna explain that? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. ####<meld>sadness
And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. ####<meld>joy
And it's not even born yet. ####<meld>sadness
It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. ####<meld>joy
I'm sorry, you were fighting. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, how are you doing Kelly? ####<meld>neutral
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great! ####<meld>joy
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can ####<meld>neutral
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick! ####<meld>disgust
This is disgusting! ####<meld>disgust
I'm not reading this! ####<meld>disgust
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!! ####<meld>surprise
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. ####<meld>neutral
I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat... ####<meld>neutral
You know he's gay? ####<meld>neutral
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut? ####<meld>neutral
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. Hi. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
Well, what? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
What is it? ####<meld>neutral
That she left you? ####<meld>surprise
That she likes women? ####<meld>neutral
That she left you for another woman that likes women? ####<meld>neutral
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... ####<meld>anger
Then what? ####<meld>neutral
My first time with Carol was... ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
It was my ####<meld>neutral
With Carol?  Oh. ####<meld>surprise
So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh. ####<meld>surprise
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! ####<meld>surprise
Hi. Where is everybody? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong? ####<meld>sadness
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over. ####<meld>sadness
Oh no! Why? ####<meld>surprise
Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny. ####<meld>surprise
Im an idiot. ####<meld>disgust
I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out and shed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know look at her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool! ####<meld>sadness
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover? ####<meld>neutral
Well, now I do!! ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Seven years. ####<meld>sadness
I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever.... ####<meld>sadness
Aw, God Ross. Oh. ####<meld>sadness
Ill do it. ####<meld>neutral
No you wont. ####<meld>neutral
Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, hes sorry. ####<meld>sadness
But,  youve got one more apology to make, all right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, absolutely! ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Youve got it. ####<meld>neutral
Cookie, now you can punch him! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
All right, that's it, I quit. ####<meld>anger
What? I didn't say anything. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. ####<meld>anger
Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person. ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. ####<meld>sadness
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it. ####<meld>anger
Julie. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Jody! ####<meld>surprise
You were with Julie? ####<meld>neutral
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. ####<meld>neutral
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, right.  Sure! ####<meld>anger
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. ####<meld>sadness
Look, I'm sorry, all right. ####<meld>sadness
I never meant for you to find out! ####<meld>sadness
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. ####<meld>anger
That is not true! ####<meld>anger
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here? ####<meld>anger
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? ####<meld>anger
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to ####<meld>sadness
Yeah! ####<meld>surprise
I cant say. ####<meld>neutral
Why?! ####<meld>surprise
Why not? ####<meld>sadness
I cant say because hes famous. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, who is it?! ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us. ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby. ####<meld>neutral
As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin? ####<meld>surprise
What?! Well he never said that to me! ####<meld>surprise
In ####<meld>neutral
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse. ####<meld>sadness
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories. ####<meld>joy
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new. ####<meld>neutral
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, let's not tell this story. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, come on! ####<meld>sadness
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head! ####<meld>joy
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, it's not like it sounds. ####<meld>neutral
It's ####<meld>neutral
Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! ####<meld>anger
Who was that? ####<meld>neutral
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress. ####<meld>sadness
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. ####<meld>sadness
Ten dollars an hour. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Twelve dollars an hour. ####<meld>neutral
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around. ####<meld>neutral
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. ####<meld>anger
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour. ####<meld>anger
Done. ####<meld>joy
The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it! ####<meld>fear
Youve got to get out of here! Save yourself! ####<meld>fear
No! I wont leave you! ####<meld>fear
Dont worry about me, Im a robot! Im just a machine!! ####<meld>sadness
No youre not! Not to me! ####<meld>anger
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
I am ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, youre great! Okay, lets take it from ####<meld>joy
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too. ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, youre solid. Yeah, youre just no me. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont want to be over rehearsed. ####<meld>neutral
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Ill do it without you! ####<meld>anger
I dont need you or anybody else! ####<meld>anger
Im gonna make it on my own! ####<meld>anger
Youll see!! ####<meld>anger
Youll ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad. ####<meld>sadness
I didn't know Ross and you were so close. ####<meld>surprise
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him. ####<meld>sadness
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. ####<meld>neutral
And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently. ####<meld>neutral
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance. ####<meld>sadness
But you didn't! ####<meld>joy
I'm still alive!! ####<meld>joy
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. ####<meld>joy
It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day! ####<meld>joy
I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people! ####<meld>joy
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you! ####<meld>anger
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!! ####<meld>joy
Well do a quick check. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
So, eight days late huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
You must be a little uncomfortable. ####<meld>neutral
Eh, just a tad. ####<meld>neutral
Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. ####<meld>neutral
It still could last a little while longer. ####<meld>neutral
If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along. ####<meld>neutral
Do them!! ####<meld>anger
Actually, theyre things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective. ####<meld>neutral
Well, we are ready to try anything. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
What is wrong with Emma? ####<meld>sadness
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa. ####<meld>neutral
Anytime you're ready. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, ok, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, where am I talking to, here? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... ####<meld>neutral
Just aim for the bump. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. ####<meld>neutral
You know, I, you know, can't do this. ####<meld>fear
Uh, this is too weird. ####<meld>disgust
I feel stupid. ####<meld>sadness
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it. ####<meld>neutral
Hello, baby. Hello, hello. ####<meld>joy
Oh, hi. Its Mark. ####<meld>neutral
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay? ####<meld>fear
Okay, I do. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I really do. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im gonna get your coat and then Ill-Ill put you in a cab. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, youre not gonna come with me? ####<meld>sadness
Of course I am. I just have to make a call. ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God! ####<meld>surprise
What?! I wh-, whats wrong? ####<meld>fear
Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like this. ####<meld>disgust
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just... ####<meld>neutral
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak! ####<meld>fear
Oh, I cant watch this. ####<meld>fear
Check it out, hes winning!  Petes winning! ####<meld>surprise
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
No-o-o!! ####<meld>fear
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area. ####<meld>fear
Oh! Oh! ####<meld>disgust
Wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it? ####<meld>surprise
Well, this is ironic. ####<meld>surprise
Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant. ####<meld>neutral
Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!! ####<meld>anger
Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers? ####<meld>neutral
We could, or we can have sex in it. ####<meld>joy
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants! ####<meld>joy
I thought I was a complete idiot. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Im with you. He even asked me if I thought youd go out with him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Oh, I think Im gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say? ####<meld>disgust
I said no. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
What? II just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people. ####<meld>surprise
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant? ####<meld>anger
I didnt tell him. I didnt know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people. ####<meld>neutral
Good-good, dont tell him. Dont tell him. Just have him call me okay? ####<meld>fear
Rach look, I really dont think thats such a great ####<meld>sadness
Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more actors! Ill meet em all! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuas gone so you and Emily are free to go. ####<meld>neutral
Thats okay. ####<meld>neutral
Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so ####<meld>neutral
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket! ####<meld>anger
You tell them to wait! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Wait! Wait! ####<meld>neutral
Emily. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily! ####<meld>anger
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman. ####<meld>sadness
Nevermind! ####<meld>anger
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in. ####<meld>neutral
Jen. ####<meld>neutral
Jen, I know this may sound a little But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or ####<meld>neutral
Sure! That would be nice. ####<meld>joy
Umm? ####<meld>neutral
Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call. ####<meld>joy
I will give you a call. ####<meld>neutral
I'll see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
I forgot my paper. ####<meld>neutral
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Ow! ####<meld>surprise
Arent you gonna go? ####<meld>neutral
No. Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms. ####<meld>neutral
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.  Well, if everybodys going. ####<meld>neutral
No, y'know what dont close it  cause the... keys...are in there. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!! ####<meld>fear
Whats going on? ####<meld>neutral
My lighters in there! ####<meld>fear
I promise. ####<meld>neutral
Although, dont feel like you cant visit. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here? ####<meld>neutral
No, no hes not. ####<meld>neutral
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband. ####<meld>surprise
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him. ####<meld>neutral
Itll kill him. I mean itll, itll just kill him. ####<meld>fear
Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe ####<meld>neutral
Hey, what are you doing here? ####<meld>neutral
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of ####<meld>neutral
Ah yeah, but now its Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home. ####<meld>neutral
Wheres Ben? ####<meld>neutral
Hes sleeping. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, yeah, actually, Susans gonna be home any minute, its kinda an anniversary. ####<meld>joy
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January? ####<meld>surprise
Its not that kind of anniversary. ####<meld>neutral
Ah!  Oh. ####<meld>surprise
Sooo!! Anyway... ####<meld>neutral
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh, oh, Ill get Rainy Day Bear!! ####<meld>joy
Because hell know what to do?  Oh my God, youre a genius! ####<meld>joy
Oh God, oh God, its sowed on though. ####<meld>fear
Give it. Give it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Oh!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today. ####<meld>sadness
Please. This is so your fault. ####<meld>anger
How, how is this my fault? ####<meld>surprise
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along. ####<meld>anger
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along. ####<meld>anger
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! ####<meld>anger
Get in here. ####<meld>anger
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
My god, you guys, I don't believe you. ####<meld>anger
There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. ####<meld>anger
So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, Susan. ####<meld>neutral
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this. ####<meld>anger
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic? ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?" ####<meld>surprise
I didnt do that! Who wouldve done that?! ####<meld>surprise
Son of a bitch! ####<meld>anger
Okay, maybe ask this guy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they? ####<meld>joy
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? The only problem is, Carls acting is ####<meld>neutral
The ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big ####<meld>neutral
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake? ####<meld>neutral
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! ####<meld>anger
Hey Monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in? ####<meld>neutral
Sure, I love this part! ####<meld>joy
Come on in. ####<meld>neutral
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment. ####<meld>joy
In the moment, yeah. ####<meld>neutral
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again? ####<meld>joy
Sure, New Years Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Me neither. ####<meld>neutral
3, 2, ####<meld>neutral
Joey, you dont have to count down every time we kiss. ####<meld>joy
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready. ####<meld>joy
Alright. Phoebe? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay. ####<meld>neutral
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever. ####<meld>neutral
See, there's always one guy.  "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." ####<meld>disgust
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent? ####<meld>neutral
Probably kill myself! ####<meld>sadness
..Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! ####<meld>sadness
Joey, uh- ####<meld>surprise
You ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Joey, onstage! ####<meld>anger
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? ####<meld>sadness
I mean, Ill go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye. ####<meld>sadness
Where are you Vic? ####<meld>neutral
Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go. ####<meld>sadness
Vic! Vic! ####<meld>anger
In a minute!! ####<meld>anger
So this is it? Victor? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I guess it is. ####<meld>sadness
Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me. ####<meld>sadness
One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. ####<meld>sadness
But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I. ####<meld>sadness
And so Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. ####<meld>sadness
But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. ####<meld>sadness
But I wont have aged at all. ####<meld>neutral
So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her. ####<meld>neutral
So long, Vic! ####<meld>sadness
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is ####<meld>neutral
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on ####<meld>neutral
What song was that, Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
Hi Monica! ####<meld>joy
Hey Mon! ####<meld>joy
Hey Mon! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God, has she slept at all? ####<meld>surprise
Nope. ####<meld>neutral
No, it's been three nights in a row. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, okay that explains it. ####<meld>neutral
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. ####<meld>neutral
But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call. ####<meld>joy
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend. ####<meld>disgust
Yeah, I know but ####<meld>neutral
Oh no-no-no, Im there. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes? ####<meld>joy
You made pancakes? ####<meld>surprise
Yep! Grab a plate. ####<meld>joy
No-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, ####<meld>neutral
Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, hero sandwiches. ####<meld>neutral
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. ####<meld>neutral
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. ####<meld>neutral
Not you Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my good God. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs. ####<meld>neutral
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now. ####<meld>anger
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me. ####<meld>joy
Oh, the mixed tape. ####<meld>neutral
The Way You Look Tonight ####<meld>joy
You are just the sweetest. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey, guess what Im doing tonight. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Im checking out the restaurant with Pete. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you. ####<meld>joy
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, actually Ive been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this! ####<meld>joy
Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someones been doing their homework. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I know.  Yknow, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda ####<meld>neutral
Oh, me too. ####<meld>neutral
and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar! ####<meld>joy
Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible. ####<meld>neutral
But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem? ####<meld>anger
It was really fun being married to you tonight. ####<meld>joy
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made. ####<meld>joy
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
That proposal, at the planetarium ####<meld>neutral
I know, I know it was stupid. ####<meld>sadness
Are you kidding?! ####<meld>surprise
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! ####<meld>joy
It wasreally wonderful! ####<meld>joy
Did you just make that up? ####<meld>surprise
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. ####<meld>neutral
Its how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. ####<meld>neutral
Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night ####<meld>neutral
Goodnight ####<meld>neutral
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up? ####<meld>neutral
I will think about it. ####<meld>neutral
Thats all Im askin ####<meld>neutral
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldnt feel bad! ####<meld>surprise
Well actually, I-I didnt eat mine. Its still in the bathroom. ####<meld>joy
No it isnt, I ate that. ####<meld>neutral
Well we left ours in Monicas bedroom. ####<meld>neutral
Nope, got it and I got yours  too. ####<meld>neutral
And thats Im so glad theres no problem. ####<meld>joy
Thats fine, actually Im on the hiring committee, so therell be at least one friendly face. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! Thats great! ####<meld>joy
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
No-ho-ho! ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, no-no-no-no-no, dont you worry, Im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy to get that job. ####<meld>neutral
Although, I might need some convincing. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I, umm ####<meld>fear
Kidding! God, I feel wild today! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Chandler just left though! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk. ####<meld>neutral
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
I think it means he freaked out and left! ####<meld>surprise
Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do? ####<meld>sadness
LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay? ####<meld>neutral
I will, I will find him. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! Hey! ####<meld>joy
Do you guys know any cute guys? ####<meld>neutral
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. ####<meld>joy
Oh, Im sorry. Thank you Chandler. ####<meld>joy
Anyway, theres this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go ####<meld>neutral
Whats the charity? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot. ####<meld>neutral
Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Its weird. But the thing is need to find a date. ####<meld>surprise
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
What are you guys doing later? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut. ####<meld>neutral
We do? ####<meld>surprise
I want to see what he wants first. ####<meld>neutral
I just found out that Elizabeths dad wants to meet me. ####<meld>sadness
Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not Elizabeths dad?! ####<meld>surprise
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. ####<meld>fear
It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good. ####<meld>sadness
Of course well help! Yeah! Well be here! ####<meld>joy
Thanks! ####<meld>joy
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hi! How are you doing? ####<meld>joy

Thanks for having me over, you guys. ####<meld>neutral

Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? ####<meld>neutral
Colorado. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, what good are you. ####<meld>neutral
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. ####<meld>sadness
Ityknow what? ####<meld>neutral
It just doesn't matter how I feel. ####<meld>sadness
I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? ####<meld>sadness
Um, I'm not. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out. ####<meld>sadness
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us. ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. ####<meld>sadness
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal! ####<meld>anger

Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid. ####<meld>anger
Your other student, was you! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder! ####<meld>anger
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! ####<meld>anger
Right here! ####<meld>anger
Here! ####<meld>anger
Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and ####<meld>neutral

You do? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. Thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends? ####<meld>sadness
Seriously. What?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
If you want to, we can do it one more time. ####<meld>neutral

Okay, yknow what? Can I, can I talk now? ####<meld>joy

And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place.... ####<meld>joy
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa! ####<meld>joy
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. ####<meld>anger
And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' ####<meld>anger
You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. ####<meld>anger

Oh what are you kidding? Shes gorgeous, its all Rachel. ####<meld>joy
Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again? ####<meld>neutral
No, I know. ####<meld>neutral
I know, because youre not in that place. ####<meld>neutral
Which would be fine, except you totally are. ####<meld>neutral
Itsits complicated okay? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer. ####<meld>neutral
Look, weve been together. ####<meld>sadness
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. ####<meld>sadness
Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma. ####<meld>sadness
I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me. ####<meld>sadness
What do they put something in the water in this place? ####<meld>neutral
Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now. ####<meld>sadness

Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble. ####<meld>neutral

Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? ####<meld>joy
Know your audience! ####<meld>joy
Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank. ####<meld>neutral
We really need to take those tests? ####<meld>sadness
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. ####<meld>neutral
I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests. ####<meld>neutral
But I don't wanna do it in a cup! ####<meld>sadness
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody? ####<meld>neutral
No. Have you seen David? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, he hasn't been around. ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk. ####<meld>neutral
Minsk? ####<meld>surprise
Minsk. It's in Russia. ####<meld>neutral
I know where Minsk is. ####<meld>neutral
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid. ####<meld>joy
So when, when do you leave? ####<meld>neutral
January first ####<meld>neutral
You wanted to see me Professor Geller? ####<meld>joy
Yes. Yes! Please, come in. ####<meld>neutral
Oo-oo! ####<meld>joy
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot. ####<meld>joy
Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our ####<meld>anger
Anyway, it wasnt the robot, it was the guy who controls him. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, he doesnt like me. ####<meld>anger
He had C.H.E.E.S.E. ####<meld>neutral
knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! ####<meld>anger
Ohh! ####<meld>surprise
Well, why dont you just get him fired? ####<meld>neutral
I may have to, I hate to do it, but Im the star! ####<meld>anger
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Theres a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me. ####<meld>neutral
Joey Tribbiani. ####<meld>neutral
Joe! Im glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya! ####<meld>joy
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
The thing is its kinda on the Q.T. ####<meld>neutral
The actor who has the part doesnt know he might be fired. ####<meld>neutral
Its the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. ####<meld>neutral
Im the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!! ####<meld>anger
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it! ####<meld>anger
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies? ####<meld>surprise
Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. ####<meld>neutral
Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it. ####<meld>neutral
Were good. ####<meld>neutral
Were really good. ####<meld>joy
Oh, did you catch him?! ####<meld>surprise
Wh-what did he say?! ####<meld>surprise
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda."  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name? ####<meld>neutral
Why?! Why not?! ####<meld>surprise
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! ####<meld>sadness
He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned! ####<meld>sadness
What did you say to him? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, sure. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, in about ten seconds youre gonna see him kiss me. ####<meld>joy
And in about five seconds youre gonna see why. ####<meld>neutral
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, get ready to see some beggin! ####<meld>joy
Oh, you came on to Ross! ####<meld>surprise
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Now Im so happy. ####<meld>joy
What are you talking about?! ####<meld>surprise
You used the Europe story! ####<meld>joy
Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex! ####<meld>anger
How do you know about that story?! ####<meld>surprise
How do ####<meld>neutral
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy! ####<meld>neutral
Some guy!! ####<meld>surprise
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams. ####<meld>neutral
Ken Adams!! ####<meld>surprise
How we doing, you guys ready? ####<meld>neutral
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature? ####<meld>neutral
Some days it's all I can think about. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings. ####<meld>neutral
Oh... ok, fine. ####<meld>neutral
But... ehm... ####<meld>neutral
I just have one question for you,    ehm... ####<meld>neutral
When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll... ####<meld>neutral
Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok,    let's go!! ####<meld>joy
I cant believe this! How long as this been going on? ####<meld>surprise
Well umm, Alexandra has been ####<meld>neutral
Oh, it has a name? ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe, dont get upset! ####<meld>sadness
OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go! ####<meld>anger
Well, Phoebe I thought IdYeah, what the hell. ####<meld>neutral
Ben! ####<meld>fear
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord. ####<meld>anger
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! ####<meld>fear
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts? ####<meld>neutral
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry! ####<meld>sadness
I got my s's back! ####<meld>joy
Which we can celebrate later. ####<meld>neutral
Celebrate. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. ####<meld>joy
Rachel, how did this happen? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night. ####<meld>fear
Where? ####<meld>neutral
At his apartment. Is this juice? ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe? ####<meld>anger
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser. ####<meld>sadness
I licked my arm, what? ####<meld>surprise
It's breast milk. ####<meld>neutral
So? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person. ####<meld>neutral
What is the big deal? ####<meld>anger
What did you just do? ####<meld>surprise
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk? ####<meld>disgust
You won't even taste it? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>disgust
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk? ####<meld>neutral
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. ####<meld>disgust
Aww! ####<meld>surprise
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet? ####<meld>disgust
Oh sure!  Noo! ####<meld>joy
Ohh!! ####<meld>surprise
My apothecary table!!! ####<meld>surprise
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Noooooo!! ####<meld>fear
Ross, where did you get this?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God, Phoebe, ####<meld>anger
Wow! Oh my God, well if theyve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars! ####<meld>anger
Well this doesnt even smell like opium. ####<meld>disgust
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way. ####<meld>anger
How is she? ####<meld>sadness
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign. ####<meld>neutral
How's the hair? ####<meld>neutral
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. ####<meld>sadness
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling. ####<meld>neutral
Can we see her? ####<meld>neutral
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in. ####<meld>sadness
How're you doing? ####<meld>sadness
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. ####<meld>joy
That would be no. ####<meld>disgust
Come on. It doesn't taste bad. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh... ####<meld>neutral
Cantaloupe juice. ####<meld>joy
Exactly. ####<meld>neutral
You've tasted it? You've tasted it. ####<meld>surprise
Uh huh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you've tasted it. ####<meld>anger
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. ####<meld>neutral
Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel. ####<meld>anger
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number. ####<meld>anger
Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names. ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you. ####<meld>neutral
Regina Philange. ####<meld>neutral
I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong. ####<meld>surprise
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes. ####<meld>anger
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke! ####<meld>surprise
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! ####<meld>anger
Well maybe it was all of your questions. ####<meld>neutral
What about my questions? ####<meld>neutral
No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Ill get it. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me. ####<meld>surprise
Relax, its not like were forking. ####<meld>joy
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay. Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful. ####<meld>joy
I know!!! ####<meld>joy
So, Im here, ready to play. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. ####<meld>joy
Whats this? ####<meld>surprise
Thats a dog, every house should have a dog. ####<meld>joy
Not one that can pee on the roof. ####<meld>surprise
Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste. ####<meld>joy
And is this in case the house sneezes? ####<meld>surprise
No, no, thats the ghost for the attic. ####<meld>neutral
I dont want a ghost. ####<meld>fear
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground. ####<meld>neutral
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
I need to talk to you! ####<meld>joy
Sure, whats up? ####<meld>neutral
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it. ####<meld>anger
Please, I'm not going for anything. ####<meld>disgust
Well, if you don't, I will. ####<meld>anger
Would you please go? ####<meld>joy
I would! ####<meld>anger
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?! ####<meld>joy
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Watch, watch. ####<meld>joy
Ooohhhh!! ####<meld>surprise
And, and! ####<meld>joy
Ahhhh!! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, my Fathers house does that! ####<meld>surprise
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything. ####<meld>neutral
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Its Emma. ####<meld>neutral
Emma!  See? I dont want it. ####<meld>sadness
Take it. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Its clearly an Emma. ####<meld>neutral
Oh honey, but you love that name. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, but I love you more. ####<meld>joy
Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing. ####<meld>neutral
So Im screwed. ####<meld>joy
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all the time! ####<meld>joy
Nice try. ####<meld>sadness
Wait, wait, wait! ####<meld>joy
Look, Monica ####<meld>neutral
Look! ####<meld>surprise
This is not going to work. ####<meld>anger
I bet this will work! ####<meld>joy
You are so great! I love you! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking! ####<meld>fear
You said you loved me! I can't believe this! ####<meld>surprise
No I didn't! ####<meld>fear
Yes, you did! ####<meld>surprise
No I didn't! ####<meld>fear
You love me! ####<meld>joy
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! ####<meld>anger
Hello Greg? ####<meld>neutral
Hi, this is Monica from the plane? ####<meld>neutral
Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5   That is their old number! ####<meld>anger
Jennys been giving it out since they moved! ####<meld>anger
Jenny! That is so Jenny! ####<meld>joy
Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? ####<meld>neutral
Say next Saturday? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, how about Sunday? ####<meld>neutral
Okay umm, the week after that? ####<meld>joy
The week after that? ####<meld>joy
Yknow what Greg? ####<meld>anger
We are good, interesting, funny people with ####<meld>anger
Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class. ####<meld>neutral
Whats a Movement class? ####<meld>neutral
Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well listen, anyway shes directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition! ####<meld>joy
Oh, I dont know man. I havent talked to her in like ten years. ####<meld>neutral
I am. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, what are you talking about? Youre a terrific actor. ####<meld>neutral
You really think so? ####<meld>surprise
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?! ####<meld>surprise
Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the ####<meld>surprise
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! ####<meld>fear
This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does! ####<meld>surprise
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Ooh! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now! ####<meld>fear
Oh, honey, dont worry. She's gonna make it on time. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey. ####<meld>neutral
But sadly I could not be enticed. ####<meld>joy
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?! ####<meld>disgust
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants. ####<meld>sadness
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. ####<meld>anger
Eh? ####<meld>neutral
All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. ####<meld>neutral
I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Well, what period is it from? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, its from yore. Like the days of yore. Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, yes I do. ####<meld>neutral
God, oh its just perfect! ####<meld>joy
I bet it has a great story behind it too. ####<meld>joy
Did they tell you anything? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains. ####<meld>joy
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place. ####<meld>joy
So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material? ####<meld>anger
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
I saw you checking me out during the game last night. ####<meld>neutral
I, umm, shut up! ####<meld>anger
Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. Ill miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this! ####<meld>sadness
Well, its pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right? ####<meld>neutral
Noooo!! ####<meld>sadness
All right, hang on! ####<meld>neutral
Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here. ####<meld>neutral
But I ####<meld>sadness
No-no, wait! ####<meld>neutral
Just let me finish, okay? ####<meld>sadness
This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. ####<meld>neutral
And it ####<meld>neutral
It is? Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore? ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>sadness
What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much! ####<meld>sadness
Im gonna miss you! ####<meld>sadness
I mean its the end of an era! ####<meld>sadness
I know! ####<meld>sadness
Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom? ####<meld>surprise
Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?! ####<meld>anger
Y'know what? ####<meld>neutral
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. ####<meld>neutral
Push! ####<meld>joy
Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. ####<meld>joy
Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! ####<meld>joy
Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. ####<meld>joy
Let's  I was justyeah, right. ####<meld>joy
Push! ####<meld>joy
Push! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, go left. Left! Left! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left! ####<meld>anger
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! ####<meld>anger
Straight up over your head! ####<meld>anger
You can do it! ####<meld>joy
You can do it! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
You got it? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, okay, I get it. ####<meld>neutral
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even ####<meld>fear
Howard's the ####<meld>neutral
Yes but too me he's just, man. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. ####<meld>anger
Ugh, can you believe that guy! ####<meld>disgust
Yeah. I really like his glasses. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
It kicked! I think the baby kicked! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here! ####<meld>fear
Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink! ####<meld>disgust
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time! ####<meld>anger
Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it. ####<meld>neutral
Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler. ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
You mind if I ####<meld>neutral
No, please. ####<meld>neutral
So uh, what are you in for? ####<meld>neutral
I talk in my sleep. ####<meld>neutral
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep. ####<meld>neutral
So why dont you give me your number? ####<meld>neutral
Previously on Friends. ####<meld>neutral
I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling. ####<meld>neutral
Oh?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, but without the costumes. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
And its not fake, its totally brutal. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre ####<meld>neutral
So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking. ####<meld>neutral
Whats fish hooking? ####<meld>surprise
Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste? ####<meld>neutral
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. ####<meld>sadness
Well, that makes me feel so good. ####<meld>joy
It was just so awkward and bumpy. ####<meld>neutral
Bumpy? ####<meld>surprise
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. ####<meld>neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it. ####<meld>neutral
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean? ####<meld>joy
Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through! ####<meld>fear
Oh well, its not so bad. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
My God! ####<meld>surprise
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday? ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
Joey! Hes working!  You would look ####<meld>anger
Oh, how bad is it? ####<meld>sadness
Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do ####<meld>sadness
Hows your room Rach? ####<meld>neutral
Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. ####<meld>sadness
Isnt that mine? ####<meld>neutral
Fine! Im sorry for your loss! ####<meld>anger
So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay? ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am ####<meld>joy
Yes, they can stay with us. ####<meld>neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman? ####<meld>neutral
Theres just so much pressure. ####<meld>anger
I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. ####<meld>neutral
I dont know if youd understand. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. ####<meld>neutral
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! ####<meld>sadness
I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time. ####<meld>fear
So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly! ####<meld>anger
Ross, we can handle this. ####<meld>neutral
Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. ####<meld>sadness
I mean, enough of the silliness! ####<meld>anger
Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly! ####<meld>anger
Okay-okay! ####<meld>anger
Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. ####<meld>sadness
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? ####<meld>sadness
That is so silly. ####<meld>joy
Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness? ####<meld>neutral
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. ####<meld>neutral
Love is the best medicine. ####<meld>joy
Thats laughter. ####<meld>joy
Why do you do it? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I do. ####<meld>neutral
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya? ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! ####<meld>joy
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
But I don't. Me, Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way. ####<meld>neutral
You're not? See, that's why you're so great! ####<meld>surprise
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! ####<meld>anger
Define me! ####<meld>anger
Love me, I need love! ####<meld>anger
Have you really done this before? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
You just take a big, big swing. ####<meld>neutral
Now, dont hold back. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey-hey! ####<meld>joy
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back. ####<meld>joy
Oh, all right. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you. ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood. ####<meld>joy
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day! ####<meld>anger
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese? ####<meld>neutral
Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday. ####<meld>neutral
Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers. ####<meld>neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down? ####<meld>neutral
Because we can remember them. ####<meld>neutral
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night? ####<meld>anger
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played ####<meld>neutral
I was always Joanne. ####<meld>neutral
Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood? ####<meld>neutral
Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King! ####<meld>disgust
Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel! ####<meld>disgust
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine. ####<meld>joy
What a wank! ####<meld>anger
Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses. ####<meld>anger
I know! ####<meld>anger
And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. ####<meld>anger
And Im appalled for you by the way. ####<meld>anger
You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone. ####<meld>sadness
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food. ####<meld>disgust
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. ####<meld>disgust
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Im, Im freaking out! ####<meld>fear
Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have! ####<meld>fear
All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. ####<meld>neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom? ####<meld>neutral
Um. yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I am ####<meld>neutral
All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. ####<meld>neutral
So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. ####<meld>neutral
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work. ####<meld>anger
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here. ####<meld>neutral
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me! ####<meld>anger
Like me tiny doctor! ####<meld>anger
Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me? ####<meld>sadness
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along. ####<meld>anger
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. ####<meld>anger
Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too! ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels. ####<meld>neutral
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear? ####<meld>neutral
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. ####<meld>neutral
Really? A purse? ####<meld>surprise
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag. ####<meld>anger
It looks like a women's purse. ####<meld>neutral
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look, ####<meld>neutral
See look, ####<meld>neutral
Exactly! Unisex! ####<meld>neutral
Maybe you need sex. ####<meld>neutral
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex. ####<meld>joy
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that. ####<meld>neutral
So, um, have you told your parents? ####<meld>neutral
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . . ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. ####<meld>neutral
no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better. ####<meld>sadness
I love you Phoebe. ####<meld>joy
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously. ####<meld>surprise

Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime. ####<meld>sadness
Why, exactly? ####<meld>surprise
Because of the weekend, we had a fight. ####<meld>sadness

Oh my god, I am losing my mind. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross! ####<meld>anger
Well, youre not. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want! ####<meld>disgust

There shouldnt be all this rules and restrictions! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever ####<meld>neutral

C'mon up. ####<meld>neutral
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. ####<meld>anger
So, I hear, you hate me! ####<meld>anger
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that. ####<meld>neutral
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me. ####<meld>anger
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there... ####<meld>fear
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. ####<meld>anger
So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together. ####<meld>neutral
But what does that gonna do... ####<meld>anger

You cant ask us son, thats cheating. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad. ####<meld>neutral
Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress. ####<meld>neutral
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress. ####<meld>joy
But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then. ####<meld>neutral
Honey, it isnt good luck. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Monica! ####<meld>surprise

Okay, okay, but Rachels gonna be here too, cant I just ask her this stuff? ####<meld>neutral

I know, me too. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? ####<meld>neutral

All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing. ####<meld>neutral

No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, youre switching apartments? ####<meld>surprise
Its not for me, its for Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
But Rachel has an apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move. ####<meld>neutral
She is? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you? ####<meld>surprise
I guess I didnt really think about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel! ####<meld>anger
Damnit! ####<meld>anger
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people? ####<meld>surprise
Little village people. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. ####<meld>joy
Oh, that is so sweet! ####<meld>joy
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these! ####<meld>joy
Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them. ####<meld>neutral
Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever! ####<meld>sadness
Wait a minute! ####<meld>surprise
Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant. ####<meld>joy
Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted! ####<meld>joy
Oh, shes gonna love that! ####<meld>joy
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment? ####<meld>neutral
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out. ####<meld>neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable. ####<meld>neutral
Fine, Im mentally unstable. ####<meld>anger
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Uh yes, heroin and crack. ####<meld>neutral
Crack isnt even an intravenous drug! ####<meld>anger
Well, you would know. ####<meld>neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, come on! ####<meld>sadness
Ross, please, I found the magazines! ####<meld>sadness
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door? ####<meld>joy
I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby! ####<meld>sadness
Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there . ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now. ####<meld>joy

Youre welcome. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! I cant believe thats our baby. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, thats our baby. ####<meld>joy
Gin. ####<meld>neutral
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked. ####<meld>joy
Will you stop! ####<meld>joy
Okay. All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you. ####<meld>joy
But you will always be the guy who peed on me. ####<meld>disgust
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you! ####<meld>joy

Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine! ####<meld>sadness
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby? ####<meld>fear
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine. ####<meld>neutral
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. ####<meld>joy
I can't believe    I didn't even think of that. ####<meld>surprise
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'... ####<meld>sadness
What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office? ####<meld>anger
It was a "Wendy's!!    " ####<meld>anger
...and then Zana, just let one rip!! ####<meld>surprise
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? ####<meld>disgust

Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke. ####<meld>anger
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there? ####<meld>anger
Yeah! ####<meld>anger
Well, Im not going to go now anyway . ####<meld>neutral
Okay . ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you want, you can work here. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow? ####<meld>neutral
And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends. ####<meld>sadness

You don't know anything. ####<meld>anger
Ohh, I know one thing! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>joy
They did it right there on the couch. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. ####<meld>anger
I mean, that guy with the toe thing? ####<meld>anger
Who's he sleeping with? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... ####<meld>neutral
I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-! ####<meld>joy
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work. ####<meld>neutral
So where did you study? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I didn't go to college. ####<meld>neutral
No, where did you study acting? ####<meld>neutral
Molly ... people don't study acting ... ####<meld>neutral

Thanx. ####<meld>neutral
Will the stable boy never get the princess?? ####<meld>sadness
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch? ####<meld>disgust
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. ####<meld>disgust
You know, this isn't fair. ####<meld>anger
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? ####<meld>anger
Huh? ####<meld>anger
Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real? ####<meld>anger
Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok? ####<meld>sadness
I didn't think I could ever love again. ####<meld>sadness
Come on! Joe! ####<meld>joy
Hi, is Molly here? ####<meld>neutral

Im next! ####<meld>anger
Its my turn! ####<meld>anger
Its only fair! ####<meld>anger
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you! ####<meld>anger
Not this hospital, Im going to sue you! ####<meld>anger
And my husband  hes a lawyer! ####<meld>anger

Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge! ####<meld>fear
They dont look any bigger than me! ####<meld>neutral
Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are. ####<meld>anger
Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right? ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral

Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for ####<meld>anger
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture. ####<meld>joy
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy. ####<meld>neutral
We just want you to think it through. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom? ####<meld>neutral
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, thank you for meeting with me. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. All right. ####<meld>neutral
Come, sit. ####<meld>neutral

Lucky sixes.... ####<meld>neutral
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
And Joey.... ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
And Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
He doesn't speak much English. ####<meld>neutral
Look at that! ####<meld>surprise
So, um... where did Paolo come from? ####<meld>neutral
Oh... Italy, I think. ####<meld>neutral
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives. ####<meld>neutral
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat! ####<meld>neutral
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him. ####<meld>neutral
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat. ####<meld>neutral
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo. ####<meld>joy
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
You betcha! ####<meld>joy
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?! ####<meld>surprise
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out. ####<meld>neutral
That cup is mine! ####<meld>anger
No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it! ####<meld>anger
All right, so are we not having dinner at all? ####<meld>sadness
Why? ####<meld>sadness
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon. ####<meld>neutral
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey. ####<meld>neutral
I know I do. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral

You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
What?! You got us evicted!! ####<meld>anger
I told you not to go down there! ####<meld>anger
Well he made Rachel cry! ####<meld>disgust
Rachel always cries! ####<meld>anger
Thats not true! ####<meld>anger
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before! ####<meld>neutral
All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled. ####<meld>neutral
Go!! ####<meld>anger
All right, all right, all right. ####<meld>neutral
I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it. ####<meld>neutral
So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him? ####<meld>joy
Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job. ####<meld>neutral
How ya feelin? ####<meld>neutral
Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it. ####<meld>neutral
Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone. ####<meld>neutral
Woooo hoooo!!! ####<meld>joy
Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing. ####<meld>anger
Why, what happened? ####<meld>surprise
Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part. ####<meld>sadness
What is the worse part? ####<meld>neutral
I cant remember which sister. ####<meld>sadness
You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!! ####<meld>anger
Whats wrong with you? ####<meld>anger
Nothing! ####<meld>anger
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. ####<meld>sadness
But um, I dont think its anything serious. ####<meld>neutral
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor! ####<meld>surprise
No way! ####<meld>anger
Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! ####<meld>anger
Why did I have to start working out again? ####<meld>disgust
Damn you 15s! ####<meld>anger
Its a trifle. ####<meld>neutral
Its got all of these layers. ####<meld>neutral
First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. ####<meld>neutral
[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.] ####<meld>neutral
then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top! ####<meld>neutral
It tastes like feet! ####<meld>disgust
I like it. ####<meld>joy
Are you kidding? ####<meld>surprise
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute? ####<meld>neutral
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox. ####<meld>neutral
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries! ####<meld>joy
Oh, oh! It's on again! ####<meld>joy
You guys, can we please not watch this all right. ####<meld>disgust

Folks, has this ever happened to you. ####<meld>neutral
You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way! ####<meld>anger
And there is Kevin. ####<meld>neutral
Can we please turn this off? ####<meld>sadness
Noo way, Kevin. ####<meld>joy
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000. ####<meld>neutral
Are you intrigued? ####<meld>surprise
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am! ####<meld>joy
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. ####<meld>neutral
Go ahead. ####<meld>neutral
This works with any milk carton. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday. ####<meld>surprise
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay. ####<meld>neutral
She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is ####<meld>anger
Good day for married people huh? ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry your husband cheated on you. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either. ####<meld>sadness
Try telling my wife that. ####<meld>sadness
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife? ####<meld>neutral
I can't wait to be with you! ####<meld>joy
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. ####<meld>neutral
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours. ####<meld>neutral
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? ####<meld>joy
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big ####<meld>joy
Arghh!! ####<meld>disgust
I cant believe Im going to lose this job! ####<meld>sadness
Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do? ####<meld>sadness

And I too am just a love machine. ####<meld>neutral

See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in! ####<meld>joy
You chipped in?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars. ####<meld>neutral

Yeah, but they didn't ask me! ####<meld>anger
Y'know? ####<meld>neutral
This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. ####<meld>joy
That's always fun to be. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, but you're making me look bad! ####<meld>anger
No I'm not. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>surprise
If anything I'm making you look better! ####<meld>joy
They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit! ####<meld>joy
Oh hey, Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Oh hey, Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. ####<meld>fear
Something to think about. ####<meld>neutral

Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? ####<meld>neutral
Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? ####<meld>neutral

Ohh, well, this is just perfect! ####<meld>anger
Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got ####<meld>anger

Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed. ####<meld>anger
I have the lung capacity of a two year old. ####<meld>neutral
Then why are you smoking? ####<meld>disgust
Well its very unsettling. ####<meld>sadness
Honey, I was wondering.... ####<meld>neutral
Hmm? ####<meld>neutral
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform? ####<meld>joy
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place. ####<meld>sadness
Hmm. ####<meld>neutral
I think I have an old band uniform from high school. ####<meld>joy
You remember not having sex in high school, right? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>sadness
Well honey, what about you? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Come on you gotta have one! ####<meld>surprise
Ugh! ####<meld>disgust
I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler. ####<meld>anger
Not at these prices. ####<meld>anger
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo! ####<meld>joy
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy. ####<meld>joy
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends. ####<meld>joy
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes. ####<meld>joy
Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters? ####<meld>joy
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. ####<meld>anger
That's OK. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, are you sure? ####<meld>surprise
Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. ####<meld>anger
We can't do that. ####<meld>neutral
What? What can't you do? ####<meld>surprise
She really said that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... ####<meld>neutral
But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight. ####<meld>neutral
'Tonight' tonight? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I think it's perfect. ####<meld>joy
Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey... ####<meld>neutral
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. ####<meld>sadness
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her. ####<meld>joy
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used. ####<meld>disgust
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon? ####<meld>neutral
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough. ####<meld>neutral
Alright, well, be good, I love you. ####<meld>joy
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect. ####<meld>anger
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid. ####<meld>sadness
Really stupid. ####<meld>anger
Really stupid. ####<meld>sadness
And I don't even know how it happened. ####<meld>sadness
I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. ####<meld>sadness
Are we okay now? ####<meld>fear
Yeah. No. No... ####<meld>anger
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door. ####<meld>neutral
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. ####<meld>neutral
You're kidding. ####<meld>surprise
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?" ####<meld>neutral
Oh there it is. ####<meld>neutral
Thats not your regular dry cleaners. ####<meld>neutral
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. ####<meld>disgust
I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store ####<meld>disgust
What?! ####<meld>surprise
A new grocery store. ####<meld>neutral
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me? ####<meld>anger
When I get up there Im going to kick some ass. ####<meld>anger
Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we both can. And we both will. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you didnt have to come in with me. ####<meld>neutral
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like ####<meld>joy
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful. ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do? ####<meld>neutral
I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing? ####<meld>joy
A little.   Now youre talking. ####<meld>neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee? ####<meld>neutral
I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend. ####<meld>joy
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out? ####<meld>joy
She mustve left. ####<meld>neutral
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team! ####<meld>anger
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours? ####<meld>surprise
That's right baby. ####<meld>joy
All right, let me in. ####<meld>neutral
No-no! Don't do it! Don't! ####<meld>fear
What? ####<meld>surprise
He's a dropper! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah, that's right! ####<meld>anger
I'm not a dropper! ####<meld>anger
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know? ####<meld>neutral
It's throwing and catching! ####<meld>anger
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Oh! That's so hard. ####<meld>surprise
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat! ####<meld>anger
Oh myOh good God! ####<meld>surprise
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing! ####<meld>anger
Baking it didn't help, huh? ####<meld>neutral
All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later. ####<meld>neutral
Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me? ####<meld>neutral
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey! ####<meld>surprise
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that! ####<meld>neutral
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays. ####<meld>neutral
Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day! ####<meld>joy
So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. ####<meld>joy
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand. ####<meld>anger
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand. ####<meld>disgust
I was shrieking... like a Marine. ####<meld>neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache. ####<meld>neutral
She's not much of a phone person. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no. ####<meld>anger
Ok, look, maybe I should just go. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe you should. ####<meld>anger
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? ####<meld>sadness
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that is so not true. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, it is. ####<meld>neutral
It isn't. ####<meld>neutral
It is. ####<meld>neutral
Isn't! ####<meld>anger
Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there. ####<meld>neutral
Its a great class. ####<meld>joy
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next? ####<meld>fear
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them ####<meld>neutral
No. No-no. No. What would ####<meld>anger
Who? Me the attacker? ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better. ####<meld>sadness
No-noReally?! ####<meld>surprise
Of course! ####<meld>joy
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh ####<meld>sadness
Ohh, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well maybe there is one thing you can do. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Anything! Anything! ####<meld>joy
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. ####<meld>neutral
This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday? ####<meld>fear
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie? ####<meld>surprise
Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials! ####<meld>sadness
Theyre all Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good! ####<meld>surprise
I did.  But it came at a price. ####<meld>neutral
But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this. ####<meld>fear
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?! ####<meld>surprise
Sure! ####<meld>joy
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? ####<meld>neutral
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! ####<meld>joy
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! ####<meld>joy
Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I like that idea. ####<meld>joy
Obviously! ####<meld>joy
I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>disgust
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely." ####<meld>joy
Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no. ####<meld>disgust
So, thats it? ####<meld>surprise
I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques. ####<meld>neutral
Which is why ####<meld>neutral
What do you have against the beautiful guest room? ####<meld>anger
I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away! ####<meld>anger
Are you mocking me? ####<meld>anger
No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey! ####<meld>joy
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed. ####<meld>joy
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but ####<meld>neutral
Cat. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you. ####<meld>joy
I love you too. ####<meld>joy
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was! ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>surprise
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments! ####<meld>joy
That's ####<meld>neutral
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has ####<meld>neutral
But ####<meld>neutral
No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!" ####<meld>disgust
Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today. ####<meld>neutral
Why not?! ####<meld>anger
Because Im dumping him today. ####<meld>neutral
What?! You said he was sweet! ####<meld>surprise
He ####<meld>neutral
Just dont pick up your phone. ####<meld>neutral
Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man! ####<meld>disgust
What? So now Im not allowed to fire him? ####<meld>surprise
You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself. ####<meld>sadness
Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week. ####<meld>neutral
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill ####<meld>disgust
Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it! ####<meld>neutral
Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch. ####<meld>sadness
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I guess I gotta go. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone? ####<meld>sadness
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. ####<meld>sadness
Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Chandler! ####<meld>surprise
Janice! ####<meld>surprise
There you are! ####<meld>surprise
There you are! ####<meld>surprise
I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane! ####<meld>sadness
No! No! I wanna see you take-off. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you? ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes. ####<meld>neutral
Was she happy you gave her the job? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant. ####<meld>neutral
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Oh hey! ####<meld>surprise
Can you, can you hang on a second? ####<meld>neutral
Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. ####<meld>neutral
can you excuse me for a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, funny you should call. ####<meld>joy
I was just looking over next weeks script. ####<meld>neutral
Canceled?! ####<meld>surprise
Like theyre taking it off the air? ####<meld>surprise
Ohh. ####<meld>neutral
All right, see you Monday. ####<meld>neutral
Were not even shootin them anymore?!! ####<meld>surprise
All right, bye! ####<meld>anger
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E! ####<meld>anger
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry Joey. ####<meld>sadness
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?! ####<meld>surprise
Its so secluded up here. ####<meld>neutral
I know. I like it up here. ####<meld>joy
I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry. ####<meld>joy
Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse? ####<meld>neutral
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that? ####<meld>fear
Honey, we dont have any bears here. ####<meld>neutral
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Ill be right back. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?! ####<meld>surprise
What are ####<meld>neutral
I came with Paul! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, I recognize the ankles! ####<meld>neutral
Get up! ####<meld>anger
Here you go honey! ####<meld>joy
Ahh. Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Diet Coke ####<meld>neutral
What the hell was that?! ####<meld>anger
A lesson in the importance of unagi. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, ####<meld>neutral
Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to ####<meld>neutral
All right, so we werent ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Im leaning. This is where I lean. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch. ####<meld>neutral
Brenda a bee! ####<meld>fear
What? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you! ####<meld>anger
I think I know whats going on here. ####<meld>disgust
You do? ####<meld>neutral
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married. ####<meld>disgust
I totally understand.  Can I ####<meld>neutral
All right, let's do it! ####<meld>joy
No, no, no. What was that? ####<meld>surprise
I know, it was the best I could get out of them. ####<meld>neutral
Well, people! ####<meld>sadness
People, people, people. ####<meld>neutral
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Show 'em how it's done. ####<meld>neutral
Count it off. ####<meld>neutral
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years. ####<meld>disgust
Yeah, invite him? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, did I do these neat enough? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, theyre fine. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>joy
If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then? ####<meld>surprise
Sure. Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there. ####<meld>sadness
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her? ####<meld>fear
Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you. ####<meld>sadness
But its absolutely your decision. ####<meld>neutral
More tea? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah sure. ####<meld>neutral
Earl Grey? ####<meld>neutral
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! So how was the doctor? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, everything went great. ####<meld>joy
Good. ####<meld>neutral
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>joy
I dont see the baby. Where is it? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again. ####<meld>joy
Could you help me with something? ####<meld>neutral
The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. ####<meld>neutral
And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive. ####<meld>neutral
I think I know who youre talking about. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in? ####<meld>joy
Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff ####<meld>neutral
Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray. ####<meld>neutral
Dr. Drake who? ####<meld>neutral
Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information. Im a doctor. ####<meld>neutral
A doctor at this hospital? ####<meld>surprise
