also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system. ####<meld>neutral
You mustve had your hands full. ####<meld>neutral
That I did. That I did. ####<meld>neutral
So lets talk a little bit about your duties. ####<meld>neutral
My duties?  All right. ####<meld>surprise
Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties. ####<meld>neutral
I see. ####<meld>neutral
But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them. ####<meld>neutral
Good to know. ####<meld>neutral
We can go into detail ####<meld>neutral
No dont I beg of you! ####<meld>fear
All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Absolutely.  You can relax ####<meld>neutral
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? ####<meld>surprise
You know? Forget it! ####<meld>sadness

Um-mm, yeah right! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! ####<meld>surprise

He was with her when he wrote this poem. ####<meld>neutral
Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. ####<meld>neutral
Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' ####<meld>neutral
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. ####<meld>sadness
Done. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise

Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Howd did it go? ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up. ####<meld>joy
Im so proud of you. ####<meld>joy
Me too! ####<meld>joy

Oh-ho-ho, yeah! ####<meld>joy
Which part exactly? ####<meld>neutral
The whole thing! Can we go? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics. ####<meld>anger
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part! ####<meld>joy
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part? ####<meld>neutral
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic. ####<meld>surprise
You fell asleep!! ####<meld>anger
There was no kangaroo! ####<meld>anger
They didnt take any of my suggestions! ####<meld>anger
Thats for coming buddy. ####<meld>neutral
Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Dont go! ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Im so sorry! ####<meld>sadness
Look! ####<meld>surprise
This guy fell asleep! ####<meld>anger
He fell asleep too! ####<meld>anger
Be mad at him! ####<meld>anger
Or, call an ambulance. ####<meld>anger
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. ####<meld>neutral
What?! What is with everybody? Its Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day! ####<meld>anger
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. ####<meld>neutral
See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity ####<meld>neutral
Okay, thats enough honey! ####<meld>neutral
I dont know.  Let me see the ring. ####<meld>neutral
Great! Okay, here. ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And ####<meld>joy
What've you been up to? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. ####<meld>neutral

Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her. ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
I'm back. ####<meld>neutral
So, are we gonna get together or what? ####<meld>neutral
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish? ####<meld>neutral
Great, I'll see you then. ####<meld>neutral
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. ####<meld>joy
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob." ####<meld>neutral
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god. You are pure evil. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this ####<meld>anger
Nobody! ####<meld>anger
Nobody respects the bucket! ####<meld>anger
You wouldn't believe what people put in here! ####<meld>anger
Look! ####<meld>anger
Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you? ####<meld>anger
No. ####<meld>neutral
This is my wedding. ####<meld>neutral

Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time. ####<meld>joy
Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now? ####<meld>disgust
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Whats wrong with you? ####<meld>disgust
Nothing! ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. ####<meld>fear
But um, I dont think its anything serious. ####<meld>neutral
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor! ####<meld>surprise
No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! ####<meld>fear
Thats a hernia. ####<meld>disgust
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s! ####<meld>anger
I love your place! Where is this guy from? ####<meld>joy
Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs. ####<meld>surprise
So much more. ####<meld>neutral
Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young. ####<meld>neutral
Okay ####<meld>neutral
But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Really. ####<meld>neutral
You dont think this is too fast. ####<meld>neutral
Get Out! ####<meld>anger
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, please!  So, what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God, wh-what happened? ####<meld>surprise
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! ####<meld>sadness
I knew that was him! ####<meld>anger
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, you ok? ####<meld>neutral
I guess. ####<meld>sadness
There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. ####<meld>neutral
I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else. ####<meld>neutral
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later? ####<meld>neutral
Or we could throw you both in ####<meld>joy
Ok, gentlemen! ####<meld>anger
Please! ####<meld>anger
Aren't we a little old for this? ####<meld>anger
I mean, we're scientists, right? ####<meld>neutral
We're academics. ####<meld>anger
And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. ####<meld>joy
GO, GO, GO! ####<meld>joy
Go, go, go! ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat! ####<meld>joy
Oy!! ####<meld>disgust
Whats with all this sand? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later. ####<meld>anger
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up. ####<meld>joy
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference? ####<meld>neutral
Rach? What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary! ####<meld>fear
It's a diaper commercial. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!! ####<meld>fear
Pizza delivery! ####<meld>joy
I'll get it! I will get that! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, the ball thing. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! ####<meld>joy
Uhh, ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear

No! ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>joy
You guys were totally right! ####<meld>joy
This is so much better than the first time we went out. ####<meld>joy
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
That was so awkward, we were really nervous. ####<meld>neutral
Didnt you sleep together? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that really calms me down. ####<meld>neutral
And! ####<meld>joy
We have so much in common! ####<meld>joy
She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do. ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
How does she do that? ####<meld>surprise
I cannot sleep in a public place. ####<meld>neutral
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. ####<meld>joy
Oh! What what what! ...Hi. ####<meld>surprise
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. ####<meld>neutral
What's going on with you? ####<meld>surprise
I got no sleep last night! ####<meld>anger
Why? ####<meld>neutral
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, and deaf. ####<meld>neutral
So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. ####<meld>neutral
You have no idea how loud they are! ####<meld>disgust
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Ew! What is that? Something exploded! ####<meld>disgust
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you? ####<meld>neutral
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking? ####<meld>surprise
Breathe, breathe, breathe. ####<meld>neutral
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead. ####<meld>surprise
Okay! You dont think I thought of that? ####<meld>anger
How can you not know which one? ####<meld>surprise
I mean thats unbelievable. ####<meld>joy
I mean, was it Gina? ####<meld>neutral
Which one is Gina? ####<meld>neutral
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, no, thats Dina. ####<meld>neutral
You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny. ####<meld>neutral
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. ####<meld>neutral
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. ####<meld>neutral
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you. ####<meld>joy
Really!? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. ####<meld>neutral
I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What? ####<meld>joy
What should I wear, now Im all nervous. ####<meld>fear

I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful. ####<meld>joy
: Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball. ####<meld>joy
Oh well, okay, good luck. ####<meld>joy

: Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me. ####<meld>neutral
No, Im good. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this? ####<meld>surprise
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so ####<meld>neutral
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition? ####<meld>surprise
Who knows? ####<meld>neutral
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much. ####<meld>neutral
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later! ####<meld>joy
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Actually, that can't happen. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. ####<meld>neutral
So it'll be either you two  or you two. ####<meld>neutral
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, it is. ####<meld>neutral
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new. ####<meld>joy
Please! ####<meld>anger
Are you kidding? ####<meld>anger
I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am. ####<meld>anger
And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you. ####<meld>joy
I think youve got concussion. ####<meld>fear
No, no, Im serious. Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you? ####<meld>fear
Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not. ####<meld>sadness
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David. ####<meld>surprise
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do". ####<meld>joy
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. ####<meld>neutral
David is going to propose to Phoebe. ####<meld>joy
What?  Why? ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, we have talked about this. ####<meld>anger
You are not supposed to give people advice! ####<meld>anger
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke? ####<meld>anger
I ####<meld>neutral
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! ####<meld>anger
She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone ####<meld>anger
Man, that's some ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's not what you want... ####<meld>neutral
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller. ####<meld>neutral
It-its great to meet you Paul. ####<meld>joy
I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens. ####<meld>neutral
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens. ####<meld>neutral
So Ross, what your problem? ####<meld>anger
Eh-whExcuse me? ####<meld>surprise
Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age? ####<meld>anger
Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny. ####<meld>fear
I ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I can, I can see that. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind. ####<meld>fear
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute. ####<meld>anger
Daddy! ####<meld>surprise
Oh well, its not on TV yet. ####<meld>neutral
Well, then its not on the wall yet. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? ####<meld>neutral
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that havent been cleaned yet? ####<meld>neutral
Ooooohh! ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Was it...? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there. ####<meld>neutral
"Ooo," what? ####<meld>surprise
Uma Thurman. ####<meld>neutral

Guys? ####<meld>anger
Guys? ####<meld>anger
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her. ####<meld>neutral
Feminist issue. That's where I went! ####<meld>neutral
She is gonna hate me. ####<meld>fear

Yep! That's hilarious! ####<meld>joy
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too. ####<meld>neutral
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily. ####<meld>neutral
What?! You totally get embarrassed! ####<meld>surprise
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are. ####<meld>neutral
Is that so? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am ####<meld>disgust
I cant believe it! ####<meld>surprise

I rode a bike! ####<meld>joy
I never thought Id be able to do that! ####<meld>joy
Thank you Ross. ####<meld>joy
Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them. ####<meld>joy
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you two are-are my I mean, Im lucky to have just one good ####<meld>neutral

Call it even?! ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Well, Im gonna go get these  in some water. ####<meld>neutral
Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding? ####<meld>surprise

Huh? ####<meld>surprise
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! ####<meld>anger
I talk to you and nothin. ####<meld>anger
You look at me, and its nothin. ####<meld>anger
Nothing. ####<meld>anger
Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice. ####<meld>joy
I have a question about this scene. ####<meld>neutral
Yes? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor. ####<meld>disgust
Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey, how about this one. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, its says so in the script! ####<meld>anger
Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch. ####<meld>anger
It doesnt say that in the script. ####<meld>anger
It does in mine! ####<meld>anger
I cant ####<meld>anger
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. ####<meld>anger
Yknow who has a great video camera? ####<meld>neutral
Greg and Jenny? ####<meld>neutral
Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em. ####<meld>neutral
Lets call em. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs! ####<meld>joy
Hello?  Eighth street deli? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin to that place. ####<meld>disgust
Uh sorry, wrong number. ####<meld>fear
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Hello?   Its the deli again! ####<meld>surprise
All right! Ill have a sandwich! ####<meld>joy
I dont think this numbers right! ####<meld>sadness
Oh come on!! ####<meld>sadness
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now ####<meld>sadness
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma? ####<meld>surprise
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. ####<meld>neutral
Sure. So how long you been... ####<meld>neutral
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships? ####<meld>neutral
Since then?! ####<meld>surprise
No, it's only been six years. ####<meld>neutral
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ####<meld>neutral
...Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Y'ever been in love? ####<meld>neutral
...I d'know. ####<meld>neutral
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes. ####<meld>neutral
You're one to talk. ####<meld>disgust
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. ####<meld>neutral
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma. ####<meld>disgust
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you. ####<meld>surprise
Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick? ####<meld>neutral
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Rach, how was work? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair. ####<meld>neutral
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. ####<meld>neutral
Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and... ####<meld>neutral
Something wrong? ####<meld>neutral
No. Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that's it? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Dude, I am sorry about what I said! ####<meld>sadness
No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name! ####<meld>disgust
Its not that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name. ####<meld>anger
So, youre just Bing? ####<meld>neutral
Because we won our apartment back! ####<meld>joy
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace! ####<meld>surprise
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four! ####<meld>anger
I dont know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha! ####<meld>surprise
All right, cut, lets pick again, pick again. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high! ####<meld>anger
Uh-huh, not as high as It worked! King! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah baby! ####<meld>joy
But, we pick again! We pick again! ####<meld>joy
Why?! ####<meld>neutral
I dont know! ####<meld>fear
Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby! ####<meld>joy
Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back! ####<meld>surprise
No they didnt! ####<meld>joy
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil? ####<meld>neutral
It's gonna be worth it. ####<meld>neutral
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right? ####<meld>neutral
Women love guys who love babies. ####<meld>neutral
It's that whole sensitive thing. ####<meld>neutral
Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe one of them will break away. ####<meld>neutral
No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. ####<meld>joy
All right, gimme the baby. ####<meld>neutral
No, I got him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, seriously you want him? ####<meld>surprise
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me? ####<meld>surprise
You wanna smell him? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head. ####<meld>joy
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? ####<meld>joy
Well, we are great guys. ####<meld>neutral
Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Well, not really. ####<meld>neutral
I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. ####<meld>neutral
Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou. ####<meld>anger
Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. What-what should I do? ####<meld>fear
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. ####<meld>neutral
I mean whats more important? ####<meld>neutral
What people think or how you feel, huh? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, you gotta follow your heart. ####<meld>neutral
Joey that is so sweet. ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday? ####<meld>neutral
I couldnt do it. ####<meld>sadness
You couldnt do it?! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Youre going out with her again! ####<meld>surprise
Going out with who? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Dana Keystone from college. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh ####<meld>surprise
No, that was Dana Caplin. ####<meld>neutral
Joey! You didnt even know her! ####<meld>surprise
Ah whatever! ####<meld>anger
Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! ####<meld>joy
Dont touch him! ####<meld>anger
Okay! ####<meld>surprise
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. ####<meld>neutral
I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. ####<meld>fear
Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! ####<meld>fear
Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! ####<meld>sadness
I mean, I love-I love this little guy! ####<meld>joy
Ah-ah!! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right? ####<meld>surprise
Here you go! ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Stupid! ####<meld>anger
I cant believe it! ####<meld>surprise
God! ####<meld>anger
Hey, how you doin? ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier... ####<meld>sadness
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed. ####<meld>neutral
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. ####<meld>disgust
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office? ####<meld>anger
You had no ####<meld>anger
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I. ####<meld>anger
But I told you, I didnt have the time! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel. ####<meld>anger
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? ####<meld>anger
You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? ####<meld>anger
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, I have to tell you something. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
But I cant tell you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Does it have to do with Joey? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed? ####<meld>neutral
No, but lets come back to that later! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Richard! ####<meld>joy
Actually, Im not here to complement the chef. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. ####<meld>neutral
Like I have nothing better to do! ####<meld>neutral
So whats up? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it was great seeing you the other night. ####<meld>joy
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that? ####<meld>neutral
No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you. ####<meld>joy
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay. ####<meld>disgust
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen? ####<meld>sadness
Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant! ####<meld>anger
Joey, I am scared to death about this. ####<meld>fear
But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help. ####<meld>fear
And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time. ####<meld>neutral
You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap. ####<meld>joy
Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me? ####<meld>anger
Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister! ####<meld>sadness
And youre my big brother! ####<meld>joy
I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world. ####<meld>neutral
Im not even scared to tell mom and dad. ####<meld>neutral
I was scared of telling you. ####<meld>fear
Well Id be scared of them, but all right. ####<meld>fear
Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. ####<meld>sadness
I want him to have his uncle. ####<meld>sadness
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey? ####<meld>sadness
Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey! ####<meld>joy
Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us. ####<meld>joy
Thats right! By his uncle too! ####<meld>joy
And by you. ####<meld>joy
Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment. ####<meld>neutral
Come here! ####<meld>joy
No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?! ####<meld>anger
I had a really nice time tonight. ####<meld>joy
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out. ####<meld>joy
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch. ####<meld>neutral
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw ####<meld>surprise
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up! ####<meld>surprise
Like it would help. ####<meld>neutral
You are so bad! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are! ####<meld>joy
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you. ####<meld>joy
Uh, it was very nice meeting you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre. ####<meld>surprise
Hi Mom, it's Jill. ####<meld>neutral
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule. ####<meld>neutral
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule. ####<meld>neutral
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was ####<meld>joy
Are you seeing anybody right now? ####<meld>neutral
Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out. ####<meld>fear
Im not-Im not-Im not gay! ####<meld>fear
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy? ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
That sounds great! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended. ####<meld>anger
Theres gravy? ####<meld>surprise
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. ####<meld>neutral
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
I think I left a donut up here. ####<meld>neutral
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so Im happy. ####<meld>neutral
Great job team! ####<meld>joy
Tomorrow at 8:30. ####<meld>neutral
Phil! ####<meld>joy
Nice job. ####<meld>joy
Stevens! ####<meld>joy
Way to go! ####<meld>joy
Joel-burg, you maniac! ####<meld>joy
I love ya! ####<meld>joy
Bing! ####<meld>joy
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident. ####<meld>neutral
Of course, you did. ####<meld>joy
Forgot something else too ya bastard! ####<meld>joy
Well, what about you? ####<meld>neutral
Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya? ####<meld>neutral
No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous. ####<meld>sadness
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you? ####<meld>joy
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do! ####<meld>sadness
Now get on out of here, you! ####<meld>joy
Hey Bob. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today? ####<meld>joy
If I see him, Ill ask. ####<meld>neutral
Toby! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Oh then you know each other. ####<meld>neutral
Were on a semi-first name basis. ####<meld>neutral
What do you think of adding him to our team? ####<meld>neutral
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes. ####<meld>surprise
Really? They love him down on six. ####<meld>surprise
But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! ####<meld>joy
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? ####<meld>neutral
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in. ####<meld>joy
You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux! ####<meld>anger
So? ####<meld>neutral
SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!" ####<meld>anger
Well then we still have a problem. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
With what? ####<meld>neutral
Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies. ####<meld>neutral
Oo! You should have one of us do it! ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, were getting ####<meld>neutral
No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff! ####<meld>joy
I call it!! ####<meld>joy
What?! No! It was my idea! ####<meld>anger
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us. ####<meld>neutral
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?! ####<meld>anger
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva! ####<meld>neutral
See, I see.... big passion in your future. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
I do. ####<meld>neutral
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up] ####<meld>joy
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. ####<meld>neutral
Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side. ####<meld>neutral
What?!?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill. ####<meld>neutral
You can spill. In the sink. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening. ####<meld>sadness
I love you, too. ####<meld>joy
Aww, good.  What? ####<meld>joy
What? Im just said. ####<meld>sadness
No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
I would love to live with you Ross.. thats-thats great! Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out. ####<meld>neutral
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! ####<meld>joy
I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. ####<meld>sadness
You just saved me! ####<meld>joy
Youre my hero! ####<meld>joy
Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! ####<meld>joy
Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya? ####<meld>joy
No. ####<meld>neutral
No, I wont. ####<meld>neutral
But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. ####<meld>neutral
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! ####<meld>anger
...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready? ####<meld>anger
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. ####<meld>joy
Lose the robe. ####<meld>neutral
Me? ####<meld>surprise
That's great. ####<meld>joy
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, I'm still working on mine. ####<meld>neutral
That's it? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, it was really hard. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, you weren't there. ####<meld>anger
Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice! ####<meld>joy
Pretty nice? ####<meld>neutral
Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this. ####<meld>neutral
We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe. ####<meld>neutral
You gotta take the canoe! ####<meld>anger
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away! ####<meld>neutral
Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe! ####<meld>anger
Good for you!! ####<meld>anger
Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen. ####<meld>neutral
One ticket to Yemen? ####<meld>surprise
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry sir, I dont understand. ####<meld>surprise
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with? ####<meld>neutral
Are you travelling with a child? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but this is the last time. ####<meld>neutral
With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. ####<meld>joy
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen. ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hows she doing? ####<meld>neutral
She? ####<meld>surprise
Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly. ####<meld>neutral
Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive. ####<meld>neutral
Well sensitive is important, pick him. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh sure, go with the sissy. ####<meld>disgust
Jason is not a sissy! ####<meld>anger
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler. ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way. ####<meld>neutral
I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve. ####<meld>neutral
It was an amazing night. ####<meld>joy
It was. It was an amazing night. ####<meld>joy
You think it looked amazing? ####<meld>sadness
Do we have a name yet? ####<meld>neutral
No, not yet. ####<meld>neutral
Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green. ####<meld>neutral
Hello baby girl. ####<meld>joy
Ah-ha, nowhere to run! ####<meld>joy
I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over ####<meld>anger
No Rachel! They got here first! ####<meld>anger
Why is Ross doing that? ####<meld>neutral
DANGER ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women! ####<meld>surprise
No thats all right. Dont worry about it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain! ####<meld>disgust
Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys! ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Look! ####<meld>neutral
Ive never lived like this before. ####<meld>disgust
I know. ####<meld>neutral
All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes! ####<meld>joy
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so ####<meld>surprise
Also so ####<meld>neutral
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"! ####<meld>neutral
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff! ####<meld>neutral
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you. ####<meld>neutral
About what? ####<meld>neutral
He's planning your birthday party. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! I love him! ####<meld>joy
You'd better act surprised. ####<meld>fear
About what? ####<meld>neutral
My surprise party! ####<meld>joy
What surprise party? ####<meld>surprise
Oh stop it. Joey already told me. ####<meld>joy
Well, he didn't tell me. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing. ####<meld>neutral
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything. ####<meld>anger
No, you are not. We tell you stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Yuh-huh! ####<meld>anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. ####<meld>anger
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. ####<meld>anger
Looks like I was second to last. ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! Hes your father.  he should be at the wedding. ####<meld>anger
I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years. ####<meld>disgust
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?! ####<meld>sadness
Its not like we run in the same circles. ####<meld>neutral
I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas. ####<meld>disgust
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles. ####<meld>neutral
Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress. ####<meld>disgust
So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. ####<meld>neutral
Hello! Whos in there? ####<meld>neutral
How ya doin? ####<meld>neutral
Who in the hell are you? ####<meld>anger
I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh? ####<meld>neutral
No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us! ####<meld>fear
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride! ####<meld>anger
Im not gonna marry Chandler! ####<meld>anger
Not after this! ####<meld>anger
Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo. ####<meld>neutral
I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry I'm late, but I left late. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
So Pheebs, what is the book about? ####<meld>neutral
I thought you said you read it in high school. ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about? ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here? ####<meld>neutral
I thought you didn't smoke. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? ####<meld>neutral
And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" ####<meld>surprise
But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time. ####<meld>neutral
We get high. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, me too. ####<meld>neutral
I'm kidding. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, me too. ####<meld>joy
Oh, are you sure you're ok? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Does it still hurt? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>sadness
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this. ####<meld>joy
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, how'd it go? ####<meld>neutral
Excellent. ####<meld>joy
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves. ####<meld>joy
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way. ####<meld>joy
You know what? You are right. I ####<meld>neutral
Good for you Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean ####<meld>neutral
This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired! ####<meld>anger
Its 6:00. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well. ####<meld>neutral
Handling it? ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean, handling it? ####<meld>joy
Theres nothing to handle. ####<meld>joy
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway! ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
Come on! ####<meld>anger
They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous! ####<meld>disgust
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off. ####<meld>neutral
Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres. ####<meld>joy
What the hell is this?! ####<meld>surprise
What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?! ####<meld>anger
This sucks! ####<meld>anger
All right, whats my next present? ####<meld>neutral
All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? ####<meld>neutral
Enhh ####<meld>neutral
Ive got canned goods. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole! ####<meld>surprise
Excellent hole, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no! No!! My hole!! ####<meld>surprise
Ow!! Ow!!! ####<meld>disgust
What?! What?!! What is it?! ####<meld>surprise
My drinking? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I mustve said that after you left. ####<meld>neutral
Said what? Exactly. ####<meld>fear
That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person! ####<meld>disgust
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! ####<meld>fear
If youre gonna get all sensitive about it! ####<meld>anger
I dont want to lose you. ####<meld>sadness
What if I, create a position for you? ####<meld>neutral
Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department. ####<meld>neutral
Say more things like that. ####<meld>joy
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow. ####<meld>joy
Id need an expense account. ####<meld>neutral
Done! ####<meld>joy
And an assistant. ####<meld>neutral
Sophie, get in here! ####<meld>joy
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses. ####<meld>joy
Oh my! ####<meld>surprise
They're male nurses. ####<meld>neutral
Not in my head. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say? ####<meld>joy
Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
What are you talking about?! ####<meld>surprise
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. ####<meld>anger
I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. ####<meld>neutral
Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, why don't you give ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some ####<meld>neutral
Yep! There's always room for ####<meld>neutral

Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Lets bring it in. ####<meld>neutral
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me. ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
That almost hit me in the face. ####<meld>anger
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding. ####<meld>joy
Oh boy, me too! ####<meld>joy
Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>fear
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?! ####<meld>neutral
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature! ####<meld>anger
Thats me! Come on! ####<meld>joy
Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch. ####<meld>neutral
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill. ####<meld>neutral
Shrill?! The wedding is back on! ####<meld>anger
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Nice to meet you! ####<meld>joy
Nice to meet you too. ####<meld>neutral
So, are you ready to go? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! ####<meld>anger
Ill be right with you. ####<meld>neutral
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
You can take it off. ####<meld>neutral
Just slice that baby right off! ####<meld>fear
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
Well that's not a third nipple. ####<meld>neutral
No? ####<meld>surprise
First of all, it's on your ass. ####<meld>neutral
Well then, what is it?! ####<meld>surprise
Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment? ####<meld>neutral
I'm with Hamilton! ####<meld>neutral
He's good with rear things, bring him in too. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, this is great wine. ####<meld>joy
Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona. ####<meld>joy
I studied for a year in Barcelona. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking ####<meld>neutral
I love hiking! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo ####<meld>joy
So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married. ####<meld>surprise
Oh we-we didnt. ####<meld>joy
No-no. We ####<meld>fear
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all. ####<meld>neutral
Why?!! ####<meld>surprise
Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well then shut me up. ####<meld>neutral
Just tell me how. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. ####<meld>fear
Let it go, Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. ####<meld>neutral
Do you all promise? ####<meld>neutral
Chandler? Do you promise to be good? ####<meld>neutral
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Dear Ms. Buffay. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you for calling attention to our error. ####<meld>neutral
We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. ####<meld>neutral

Honey, both yours. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing! ####<meld>joy
Yeah? The work problem? ####<meld>neutral
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again. ####<meld>joy
What problem did you tell him you had? ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties? ####<meld>neutral
No thanks, Mom! ####<meld>disgust
Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha! ####<meld>anger
Very good,  so good. ####<meld>joy
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic. ####<meld>joy
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call. ####<meld>sadness
I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club. ####<meld>sadness
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont! ####<meld>sadness
Come on! Look where you are!! ####<meld>joy
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris. ####<meld>neutral
Remember, a virgin for me please. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you think it will help. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
That was a test! ####<meld>fear
In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! ####<meld>fear
And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice ####<meld>fear
You should! How is she? ####<meld>surprise
Ohhh!! ####<meld>anger
I think somebody needs another lap dance. ####<meld>joy
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg. ####<meld>neutral
You do? ####<meld>surprise
You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman. ####<meld>surprise
That and arrogance. ####<meld>anger
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! How was sailing? ####<meld>joy
Wow thanks! ####<meld>joy
Joe? ####<meld>fear
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Uh, youve had a lot of sex right? ####<meld>neutral
When? Today? Some, not a lot. ####<meld>surprise
Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt. ####<meld>fear
There huhhmm, there-there was an incident. ####<meld>fear
Dont worry about that man, that happens. ####<meld>neutral
Its happened to you? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Once. ####<meld>neutral
Well, whatd you do? ####<meld>surprise
I did it anyway. ####<meld>neutral
Sup? Sup dude? ####<meld>neutral
Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me. ####<meld>fear
So youre playing a little ####<meld>neutral
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19. ####<meld>disgust
Come on man, really how old?! ####<meld>surprise
Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear! ####<meld>disgust
And they knew about it? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about? ####<meld>surprise
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is! ####<meld>anger
The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer. ####<meld>disgust
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right? ####<meld>neutral
Do you always have to bring him here? ####<meld>anger
I didn't wanna leave him alone. ####<meld>neutral
Alright? ####<meld>neutral
We- we had our first fight this morning. ####<meld>neutral
I think it has to do with my working late. ####<meld>neutral
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that'd be great! ####<meld>joy
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie. ####<meld>neutral
Check this out. ####<meld>neutral
It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! ####<meld>surprise
"Its almost as good as being there." ####<meld>neutral
Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear! ####<meld>joy
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood! ####<meld>joy
Uh, may I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed. ####<meld>neutral
Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller. ####<meld>neutral
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king. ####<meld>neutral
Nobody sees the king! ####<meld>anger
Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! You cant go back there! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a ####<meld>sadness
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. ####<meld>neutral
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India. ####<meld>neutral
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea. ####<meld>joy
Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise. ####<meld>neutral
No, I just I think that its too soon. ####<meld>joy
No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven. ####<meld>neutral
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. ####<meld>neutral
And now you want that money back. ####<meld>surprise
Exactly. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? ####<meld>joy
Its not a real game! I made it up! ####<meld>anger
Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. ####<meld>joy
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
But I can see through your sheet. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, that's her. ####<meld>neutral
But y'know what? ####<meld>neutral
Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway. ####<meld>sadness
Why? ####<meld>neutral
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something. ####<meld>sadness
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left! ####<meld>surprise
No. No. No. She lives on the ####<meld>neutral
No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. ####<meld>neutral
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. ####<meld>neutral
You've been counting wrong. ####<meld>neutral
I did ####<meld>anger
Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this. ####<meld>fear
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. ####<meld>joy
Why? Do you have the answers written on there? ####<meld>surprise
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me. ####<meld>neutral
All right, lets do it. ####<meld>fear
All right, gentlemen, youre up first. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie? ####<meld>neutral
Big fat goalie. ####<meld>neutral
Correct. Rachel claims ####<meld>neutral
Dangerous Liaisons ####<meld>neutral
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is... ####<meld>neutral
Weekend at Bernies ####<meld>neutral
Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, come on, we can be guys! ####<meld>joy
No you cant. ####<meld>joy
You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long. ####<meld>disgust
Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!! ####<meld>anger
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. ####<meld>surprise
You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game. ####<meld>fear
Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men. ####<meld>neutral
Pete, can I get you something else? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out. ####<meld>neutral
Havent you and I covered that topic? ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food. ####<meld>joy
Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth. ####<meld>joy
And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. ####<meld>disgust
Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? ####<meld>neutral
I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean. ####<meld>disgust
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. ####<meld>disgust
I mean really, think about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ho-ho, I will. ####<meld>neutral
I believe I read that somewhere! ####<meld>surprise
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ####<meld>anger
Okay? ####<meld>anger
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... ####<meld>anger
It's not funny! ####<meld>anger
I respectfully disagree. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page! ####<meld>anger
Who cares? Nobody reads those things ####<meld>neutral
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today. ####<meld>anger
I don't have a page. ####<meld>neutral
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!! ####<meld>anger
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. ####<meld>joy
Okay, what is in here? Rocks? ####<meld>surprise
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. ####<meld>neutral
So, rocks. ####<meld>disgust
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. ####<meld>sadness
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little? ####<meld>joy
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move. ####<meld>joy
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice ####<meld>sadness
You ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up! ####<meld>joy
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised? ####<meld>joy
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, its time to go. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? ####<meld>neutral
Twice? ####<meld>neutral
Well thats ambitious. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, uh, you can ignore that. ####<meld>neutral
Thats Carol with your son! ####<meld>surprise
Mornings here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the mornings here! The mornings here! ####<meld>joy

Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor! ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? I am ####<meld>neutral

Yep! I sure know how to pick em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this! ####<meld>sadness
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too. ####<meld>anger

Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Transit Authority? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, hello. ####<meld>neutral
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, here's the deal. ####<meld>neutral
We lost a carseat on a bus today. ####<meld>neutral
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and there was a baby in it. ####<meld>neutral
He wants to talk to you again. ####<meld>neutral

Good evening, sir. ####<meld>neutral
My name is Ross Geller. ####<meld>neutral
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. ####<meld>neutral
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry. ####<meld>neutral
I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you. ####<meld>joy
Man, I wish I was naked. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, this-this looks so great. ####<meld>joy
That is how God intended it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! ####<meld>anger
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! ####<meld>anger
Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! ####<meld>joy
Okay, you go! ####<meld>anger
My turn? What-what are you talking about? ####<meld>surprise
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler. ####<meld>disgust

Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out. ####<meld>joy
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone. ####<meld>anger
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most ####<meld>neutral
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler. ####<meld>anger

A test?!! ####<meld>surprise
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!! ####<meld>joy
Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla? ####<meld>neutral
Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him. ####<meld>neutral
Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put. ####<meld>neutral
I think its best sir. ####<meld>neutral
But we really do need to find someone up here. ####<meld>neutral
The work is starting to pile up. ####<meld>neutral
Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a good one. ####<meld>neutral

Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, for you! ####<meld>joy
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God! ####<meld>surprise
That's ####<meld>neutral
Hey, I've been honing! ####<meld>anger
What was with the dishes? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh.. ####<meld>fear
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? ####<meld>fear
I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. ####<meld>anger
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here! ####<meld>anger
Great, now he's waving back. ####<meld>disgust
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. ####<meld>disgust
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. ####<meld>disgust
It creeps me out! ####<meld>anger
I feel like I can't do stuff! ####<meld>anger
What kinda stuff? ####<meld>joy
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked. ####<meld>disgust
You cook naked? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. ####<meld>neutral
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that. ####<meld>surprise
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps. ####<meld>neutral
Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know. ####<meld>sadness
Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to. ####<meld>neutral
You think you know me so well. ####<meld>anger
Well, dont cha wanna? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well I do know you. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what I said. ####<meld>neutral
Well so? ####<meld>neutral
I cant. ####<meld>sadness
I cant. ####<meld>sadness
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone. ####<meld>sadness
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? ####<meld>neutral
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal. ####<meld>neutral
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. ####<meld>joy
Nuh-uh. ####<meld>fear
Yuh-huh. ####<meld>joy
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what? ####<meld>surprise
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. ####<meld>disgust
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my ####<meld>anger
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one? ####<meld>anger
That's the rule. ####<meld>neutral
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! ####<meld>anger
How'd you get to that? ####<meld>anger
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio ####<meld>anger
You knew about that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, ok, How about if we split it? ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean, like, buy it together? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah ####<meld>neutral
You think we're ready for something like that? ####<meld>neutral
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out? ####<meld>neutral
Why, are you moving out? ####<meld>surprise
I'm not moving out. ####<meld>neutral
You'd tell me if you were moving out right ####<meld>fear
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip... ####<meld>neutral
Aw, I know all about Kip! ####<meld>anger
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly. ####<meld>anger
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? ####<meld>sadness
Aw, don't do that ####<meld>sadness
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment. ####<meld>sadness
Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you. ####<meld>neutral
No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry! ####<meld>fear
Aw forget it, its from ####<meld>neutral
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!! ####<meld>anger
Yknow this is actually not a great time for me. ####<meld>sadness
Okay! So, well just stay married. ####<meld>joy
Yes, exactly! ####<meld>joy
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! ####<meld>joy
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more. ####<meld>joy
What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>anger
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! ####<meld>joy
Its ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, okay, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Youre right. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Im asking you to do me a favor. ####<meld>neutral
You are asking me to be your wife! ####<meld>anger
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. ####<meld>joy
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it? ####<meld>neutral
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her- ####<meld>neutral
-leg? ####<meld>neutral
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch. ####<meld>neutral
You actually broke her watch? ####<meld>surprise
Barry, I'm sorry... ####<meld>sadness
I am so sorry... ####<meld>sadness
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway... ####<meld>sadness
No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan. ####<meld>neutral
Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. ####<meld>joy
Okay, okay, bye ####<meld>neutral
So what are they doing? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, something girlie. ####<meld>joy
Hey, youre early. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing with the lamp? ####<meld>surprise
Im just taking it to be re-wired. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week. ####<meld>disgust
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here. ####<meld>neutral
Youre disturbing my oboe practice. ####<meld>anger
You dont play the oboe! ####<meld>anger
I could play the oboe! ####<meld>anger
Ohhh! That is soo sweet! ####<meld>joy
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me. ####<meld>joy
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! ####<meld>anger
What is going on? ####<meld>surprise
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!! ####<meld>anger
Ross! ####<meld>surprise
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! ####<meld>anger
What do I have to do to get some service?! ####<meld>anger
Hi Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Ross? ####<meld>neutral

Hey its Mona! From the wedding. ####<meld>joy
Oh hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Wow! Uhhow are you? ####<meld>surprise
Im good except umm, you still owe me a dance. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film? ####<meld>joy
Oh youre serious. Sure! ####<meld>surprise
Great! Well umm ####<meld>joy
I think I might need one more cup of coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. ####<meld>sadness
Go! ####<meld>anger
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is? ####<meld>surprise
I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit. ####<meld>anger
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God Oh, hes in there right now? ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, lets rip! ####<meld>fear
Really? Are you sure? ####<meld>surprise
Oh Phoebe! ####<meld>joy
Okay, sorry. Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. ####<meld>joy
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and    I wanted to share it with you. ####<meld>joy
Oh, you're so wonderful. ####<meld>joy
It can’t be me, I’m standing right here. ####<meld>neutral
Wanna peek? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>disgust
Come on! ####<meld>surprise
We’re not peeking? ####<meld>sadness
Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Hello sir, you know Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler is fantastic!! ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow how people just click? ####<meld>joy
Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! ####<meld>joy
Did he tell you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart? ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know... ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through. ####<meld>joy
Isnt this great?! ####<meld>joy
Dont spoil it. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, sweetie! ####<meld>joy
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, huh. ####<meld>neutral
I?ve got some bad news. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>fear
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here. ####<meld>neutral
Come on sweetie! You?ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time? ####<meld>sadness
But work comes first!  Oh hey, but that?s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya? ####<meld>joy
Nooo, he?s leaving for a better job. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well that?s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye. ####<meld>joy

So, see ya on Saturday. ####<meld>neutral

Whazzup?? ####<meld>neutral
Seriously dude, 3 years ago. ####<meld>joy
Listen, can you do me a favor? ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna be out today. ####<meld>neutral
Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly? ####<meld>neutral
You don't trust him? ####<meld>surprise
I think the check in is that way. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh. ####<meld>neutral
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be! ####<meld>neutral
Well theres some people who do want to marry me. ####<meld>anger
There are? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Richard! ####<meld>anger
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?! ####<meld>surprise
Thats right. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler ####<meld>neutral
You just told me that he hates marriage! ####<meld>surprise
That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! ####<meld>anger
That-that hes against marriage and always will be! ####<meld>anger
You got ####<meld>neutral
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. ####<meld>fear
I knew. ####<meld>neutral
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. ####<meld>surprise
I did. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>sadness
Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? ####<meld>fear
Sometime? ####<meld>neutral
Maybe? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, maybe... ####<meld>joy
Okay... okay, maybe I will... ####<meld>joy
Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend. ####<meld>neutral
Well, youre amazing. ####<meld>joy
Oh no-no-no. ####<meld>neutral
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? ####<meld>surprise
Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I dont know. ####<meld>fear
Oh-no-no-no, you are! ####<meld>joy
You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that. ####<meld>joy
You mean with Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool. ####<meld>neutral
Or Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Could be Casey. ####<meld>neutral
No. No, Kathy. ####<meld>neutral
Consider Casey. ####<meld>neutral
I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. ####<meld>joy
How bout I fix you two up? ####<meld>joy
What do you think? ####<meld>joy
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! ####<meld>joy
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end? ####<meld>neutral
Honey, whats the matter? ####<meld>neutral
I just saw Janice. ####<meld>neutral
Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know..... ####<meld>joy
Wow! This girl is good. ####<meld>surprise
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. ####<meld>anger
I like her. ####<meld>neutral
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time? ####<meld>neutral
Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people. ####<meld>neutral
Look at you. All jealous. ####<meld>anger
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more ####<meld>neutral
Say you'll stay beside me ####<meld>sadness
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done. ####<meld>anger
Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. ####<meld>neutral
I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, hello. ####<meld>neutral
I have a question. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. ####<meld>neutral
A beard and a moustache. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
No, ####<meld>neutral
What?! What else did he say? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. ####<meld>neutral
So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, no! There is ####<meld>anger
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I am a human doodle!! ####<meld>anger
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! ####<meld>neutral
And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna ####<meld>neutral
Okay, there was ####<meld>neutral
Come on! ####<meld>joy
Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies? ####<meld>joy
No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I dont ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!! ####<meld>surprise
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade? ####<meld>neutral
So?! ####<meld>disgust
Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up! ####<meld>disgust
Oh right, right. ####<meld>neutral
I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex? ####<meld>disgust
Well usually...yeah! ####<meld>surprise
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. ####<meld>neutral
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. ####<meld>neutral
Im such a jerk. ####<meld>sadness
Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it. ####<meld>neutral
Hmmm... this is so nice. ####<meld>joy
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment. ####<meld>neutral
OK. ####<meld>neutral
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um.... ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh!!!! ####<meld>surprise
Yes, yes, that's right... ####<meld>neutral
Oh, look at the little cat! ####<meld>surprise
What?  Ow! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point. ####<meld>neutral
I didn't mean ####<meld>neutral
It's brilliant! ####<meld>joy
Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! ####<meld>joy
well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Sincerely. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help. ####<meld>joy
David, I'm pretending to ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! ####<meld>joy
Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half! ####<meld>anger
We are switching at the next rest stop and ####<meld>anger
All right. All right. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice. ####<meld>anger
Really? I dont ####<meld>surprise
Sing!! ####<meld>anger
Morning! ####<meld>joy
Everything was delicious! ####<meld>joy
Thank you! ####<meld>joy
It was. The duck in particular was superb. ####<meld>joy
Thank you!    You haven't said anything... ####<meld>joy
Actually I do have one small complaint. ####<meld>neutral
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. ####<meld>neutral
The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer! ####<meld>sadness
What musician? ####<meld>surprise
We did? ####<meld>neutral
You owe me 20 bucks. ####<meld>joy
Thank you. Thank you so much! ####<meld>joy
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. ####<meld>neutral
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? ####<meld>surprise
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? ####<meld>anger
All right, I'm nine years old. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I hate this story. ####<meld>sadness
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. ####<meld>neutral
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my god. ####<meld>surprise
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, who's this little naked guy? ####<meld>surprise
That little naked guy would be me. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, look at the little thing. ####<meld>surprise
Who are those people? ####<meld>surprise
Got me. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? ####<meld>surprise
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? ####<meld>neutral
Looks like a fun gang. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! ####<meld>joy
So, whats this about? ####<meld>joy
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater. ####<meld>neutral
No.  This is my red sweater. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay. ####<meld>fear
Whats going on Rach? ####<meld>joy
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare? ####<meld>fear
Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called. ####<meld>joy
I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together. ####<meld>joy
Oh, its just not the right time. ####<meld>sadness
It is the right time. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Kay! ####<meld>joy

Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Can he handle the stick? ####<meld>neutral
Oh well ####<meld>neutral
I can handle the stick!! ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing? ####<meld>sadness
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass? ####<meld>sadness
Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true! ####<meld>surprise
Chandler Bing! ####<meld>surprise
Janice ####<meld>surprise
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything. ####<meld>joy
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen? ####<meld>surprise
Its you. This is yours. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years! ####<meld>joy
Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt? ####<meld>fear
Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here. ####<meld>neutral
I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? Really? No ones home? ####<meld>surprise
I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there ####<meld>neutral
Hey, what's up? ####<meld>neutral
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! ####<meld>anger
You had no relationship!! ####<meld>anger
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan! ####<meld>anger
Oh God, stop with the plan! ####<meld>anger
So what, so what you saw him with a girl? ####<meld>neutral
Who cares?! ####<meld>anger
That doesn't mean anything! ####<meld>anger
Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl. ####<meld>neutral
She was kinda stupid. ####<meld>neutral
You're right. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna go on the date. ####<meld>neutral
That is the new plan. ####<meld>neutral

Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people. ####<meld>neutral
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that? ####<meld>anger
I do it every year. ####<meld>neutral
You do that every year?? ####<meld>surprise
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!! ####<meld>anger
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us?? ####<meld>anger
Yeah... ####<meld>neutral
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant? ####<meld>anger
Yeah... ####<meld>neutral
OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory? ####<meld>anger
Who's this from? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that's Ross's. ####<meld>neutral
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered. ####<meld>surprise
Remembered what? ####<meld>neutral
It was like months ago. ####<meld>surprise
We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe he remembered! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe he did this. ####<meld>surprise
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? ####<meld>neutral
What did you just say? ####<meld>surprise
F-hah.... flennin.... ####<meld>fear
Oh.... my God. ####<meld>surprise
I really like waking up with you. ####<meld>joy

That would be great! ####<meld>joy
We could have breakfast in bed ####<meld>joy
Wait, just a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Oh! Oh no. ####<meld>surprise
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from ####<meld>sadness
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  Youre Bonnie? ####<meld>surprise

Oh no, Im sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you. ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that must be it. ####<meld>neutral
Well I hope you have fun tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks! You too. ####<meld>joy
I believe it. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I do. ####<meld>neutral
No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this. ####<meld>anger
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right. ####<meld>anger
I do not always have to beokay, okay. ####<meld>anger
Jurassic Park ####<meld>neutral
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night. ####<meld>fear
Maybe we should check the trash chute. ####<meld>neutral
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute. ####<meld>neutral
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
There he is! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!! ####<meld>anger
Just, y'know out. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there! ####<meld>anger
What were you doing? ####<meld>neutral
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while. ####<meld>neutral
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone. ####<meld>surprise
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want! ####<meld>anger
He hooked up!! Tell us about her! ####<meld>joy
Ross you left you scarf in Hey you guys. ####<meld>neutral

Im marrying her. ####<meld>joy
Well just see. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! ####<meld>anger
Hi Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! How you doin? ####<meld>neutral
He has the most amazing Porsche under there! ####<meld>joy
Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. ####<meld>neutral
Shes sleeping. ####<meld>neutral
Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? ####<meld>neutral
Well, the old lady died. ####<meld>sadness
And how do I know? ####<meld>neutral
Her dying wish was for one last kiss. ####<meld>neutral
But I dont care,  because you got the apartment. ####<meld>joy
Yes! ####<meld>joy
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here. ####<meld>disgust
Isnt that great? ####<meld>joy
Ezels!! ####<meld>disgust
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, its not your fault. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, thats great. ####<meld>joy
Oh, yeah! ####<meld>joy
Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign. ####<meld>neutral
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no. ####<meld>neutral
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up. ####<meld>joy
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, great. ####<meld>joy
You freak. ####<meld>disgust
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Um, coffee to go, please. ####<meld>neutral
Isabella Rosselini. ####<meld>neutral
Are you serious?  Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list. ####<meld>anger
Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, maybe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh, you lie. ####<meld>disgust
What you dont think Id go up to her? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. ####<meld>anger
You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, hold my crawler. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this? ####<meld>surprise
Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just sorry we dont got popcorn. ####<meld>joy
Okay, that's, that's enough. ####<meld>neutral
Won't you dance around with me. ####<meld>neutral
A-ha!!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies! ####<meld>joy
Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
It's me, Joey! ####<meld>joy
Do I know you? ####<meld>surprise
Joey! ####<meld>joy
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy. ####<meld>neutral
Okay thats fair. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Good! ####<meld>neutral
Pick one. ####<meld>neutral
Left!  Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Youre welcome. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! ####<meld>surprise
Joey!  We should just switch. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you. ####<meld>sadness
Oh thats all right! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, I ended up having a really good time. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness. ####<meld>joy
So what was it for anyway? ####<meld>neutral
I wanna say a disease. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh Professor Geller. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, to be 13 again. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets? ####<meld>neutral
No! He blew us off! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I know! ####<meld>surprise
I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now. ####<meld>anger
Can I tell you something? Me too. ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him ####<meld>anger
Ooooh! Freeze him out. ####<meld>joy
Thats right! ####<meld>joy
I like it! ####<meld>joy
Doorknob? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good. ####<meld>joy
Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. ####<meld>fear
So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet. ####<meld>sadness
Its-its too soon. ####<meld>fear
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks. ####<meld>surprise
No. I think you misunderstood what ####<meld>surprise
You are so adorable. ####<meld>joy
That! Lets talk about that. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
How do you feel? ####<meld>neutral
Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so I ####<meld>neutral
And protected them from a tornado? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
I know, the babies are asleep. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, what, what happened here?! ####<meld>surprise
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself! ####<meld>joy
But my apartment! ####<meld>surprise
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. ####<meld>neutral
Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! ####<meld>neutral
When will that be? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! ####<meld>anger
Hey Ross! The babys kicking! ####<meld>joy
What?! It is?! ####<meld>surprise
Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again. ####<meld>joy
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened? ####<meld>joy
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping ####<meld>joy
A dreamless sleep. ####<meld>neutral
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! ####<meld>joy
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! ####<meld>neutral
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
When are you coming home? ####<meld>neutral
What? Guys, I'm not. ####<meld>surprise
C'mon, this is us. ####<meld>neutral
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job- ####<meld>neutral
Waitressing? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. ####<meld>neutral
I'm.. ####<meld>neutral
I, um... ####<meld>neutral
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... ####<meld>neutral
I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies. ####<meld>sadness
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then? ####<meld>neutral
So, um, will you bring the truck? ####<meld>neutral
I'll even let you ring the bell. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, my god. ####<meld>surprise
See, there you go, the cleansing works! ####<meld>joy
They're nice guys. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, they're firemen guys. ####<meld>joy
Your son. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie. ####<meld>anger
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. ####<meld>neutral
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, ####<meld>surprise
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. ####<meld>anger
I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps. ####<meld>anger
No, you don't. ####<meld>neutral
All right, that's it. I want both of you out. ####<meld>anger
Why? ####<meld>surprise
He started it! ####<meld>anger
No, you started it. ####<meld>anger
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. ####<meld>anger
Now go! ####<meld>anger
Thanks a lot. ####<meld>anger
See what you did. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, listen... ####<meld>neutral
Out ####<meld>anger
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say? ####<meld>joy
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice. ####<meld>surprise
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. ####<meld>neutral
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times. ####<meld>neutral
You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali. ####<meld>neutral
Boutros Boutros Gali. ####<meld>neutral
He says he was too. ####<meld>neutral
Interesting. ####<meld>neutral
So I was wondering.... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit. ####<meld>joy
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. ####<meld>joy
So you're a chef? ####<meld>neutral
Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant. ####<meld>joy
Oh, really. ####<meld>surprise
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I was having a conversation. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other. ####<meld>anger
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation? ####<meld>anger
That would be great. Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera! ####<meld>disgust
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. ####<meld>neutral
When did that happen to you?! ####<meld>surprise
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera! ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it. ####<meld>joy
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants. ####<meld>anger
Here, I'll get it. ####<meld>neutral
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set. ####<meld>neutral
Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight. ####<meld>joy
Oh, great! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, bye!  Oh my God!! ####<meld>joy
That was unbelievable! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach. ####<meld>sadness
I don't believe they're brother and sister. ####<meld>surprise
They're brother and sister!!! ####<meld>surprise
Action! ####<meld>neutral
I found the picture! ####<meld>anger
What picture?! ####<meld>surprise
The picture of my wife! In your pack! ####<meld>anger
You went through my personal property? ####<meld>anger
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?! ####<meld>anger
Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years! ####<meld>anger
Cut! Wonderful! ####<meld>joy
Great scene yeah? ####<meld>joy
Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me. ####<meld>joy
Heres your call sheet for tomorrow. ####<meld>neutral
I know. ####<meld>neutral
So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged. ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, I should probably call them. ####<meld>neutral
I remember when we first got engaged. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened. ####<meld>joy
You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy! ####<meld>disgust
What a sweet story. ####<meld>neutral
Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party. ####<meld>disgust
What?! They wanted a scary story! ####<meld>surprise
Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
You tell her Jack, I cant do it. ####<meld>fear
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you? ####<meld>surprise
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house. ####<meld>neutral
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one, ####<meld>neutral
Did that! ####<meld>joy
Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh! ####<meld>surprise
Was it not pain-free? ####<meld>surprise
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax. ####<meld>disgust
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad. ####<meld>neutral
Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. ####<meld>anger
But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest. ####<meld>neutral
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!! ####<meld>surprise
Now umm, remember Im still learning. ####<meld>neutral
One, two, three, four! ####<meld>neutral
You know the song! Sing along! ####<meld>joy
So? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! Thats David! ####<meld>surprise
David who? ####<meld>neutral
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David! ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe? ####<meld>surprise
David!  What-what are you doing here? Arent you supposed to be in Russia? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, Im just, Im just in town for a conference. Umm, ####<meld>neutral
Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut? ####<meld>joy
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Santa's coming! ####<meld>joy
Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today. ####<meld>sadness
Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right? ####<meld>neutral
But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides ####<meld>neutral
Whatever. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Mon, back me up here. ####<meld>neutral
Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? ####<meld>neutral
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right? ####<meld>neutral
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. ####<meld>sadness
Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it. ####<meld>sadness
Yknow, hey I understand. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right? ####<meld>neutral
So its yknow, its uh, its cool. ####<meld>neutral
Ill see you tomorrow. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave. ####<meld>neutral
You did look like an idiot. ####<meld>joy
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. ####<meld>neutral
All right? ####<meld>neutral
Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" ####<meld>joy
And it came out, "Squatternut buash?" ####<meld>joy
Yeah that's the same. ####<meld>neutral
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving. ####<meld>sadness
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, for me anyway. ####<meld>sadness
And of course, the Indians. ####<meld>sadness
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story! ####<meld>anger
Hi, guys. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Phoebe. ####<meld>joy
Hi Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow. ####<meld>sadness
No we ####<meld>neutral
Hormones. ####<meld>neutral

Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though! ####<meld>joy
No leg-chewing for us sir. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, give it time. ####<meld>neutral
So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate. ####<meld>joy
How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night? ####<meld>neutral
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. ####<meld>joy
They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ill see you tomorrow! ####<meld>joy
Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow. ####<meld>neutral
I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. ####<meld>disgust
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding? ####<meld>disgust
No. ####<meld>neutral
Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party. ####<meld>disgust
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts ####<meld>disgust
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs ####<meld>neutral

I think I need a drink. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral

Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. ####<meld>neutral
And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape. ####<meld>neutral

Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you back, Ive got a Schemp in my office. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again. ####<meld>neutral
Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop. ####<meld>neutral
Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes? ####<meld>neutral
I dont have ten minutes!! ####<meld>anger
What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont! ####<meld>anger
Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week. ####<meld>sadness
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would you just go home, Ill talk to you later. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but wait... ####<meld>neutral
Good bye! ####<meld>neutral
Actually, thats our three hole punch. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah? When? ####<meld>surprise
I'll tell you what. ####<meld>neutral
When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one? ####<meld>neutral
Why won't I be married when I'm 40? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40? ####<meld>anger
No, no, no. ####<meld>neutral
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me? ####<meld>anger
Uh, uh. ####<meld>neutral
Well? ####<meld>surprise
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! ####<meld>surprise
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress. ####<meld>surprise
Did you go home and change? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by? ####<meld>neutral
No, I haven't seen him. ####<meld>neutral
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him? ####<meld>surprise
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, why? ####<meld>neutral
No reason. ####<meld>neutral
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas! ####<meld>joy
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, thats her. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow what would work? ####<meld>neutral
Stop making candy! ####<meld>anger
You mean they like you. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe. ####<meld>neutral
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? ####<meld>anger
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT! ####<meld>anger
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me! ####<meld>joy
Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then! ####<meld>joy
What? We could do it! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then. ####<meld>joy
I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go. ####<meld>neutral
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ####<meld>neutral
I cant do it! ####<meld>sadness
Now you do that, youre on TV. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards... ####<meld>neutral
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid" T-shirt anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I like it. Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day? ####<meld>anger
Oh, I embarrass you? ####<meld>surprise
How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you? ####<meld>neutral
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them? ####<meld>neutral
Theyre all tourists. ####<meld>neutral
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself. ####<meld>disgust
Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat. ####<meld>neutral
Good choice. ####<meld>anger
Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! ####<meld>anger
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. ####<meld>anger
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ####<meld>surprise
You don't even know me... ####<meld>anger
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this. ####<meld>sadness
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... ####<meld>sadness
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, heres what were gonna do. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. ####<meld>neutral
You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
All right, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
Haul ass!!! ####<meld>neutral
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. ####<meld>neutral
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer... ####<meld>neutral
...and live forever as a machine! ####<meld>joy
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? ####<meld>joy
You and I, we're interfacing. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I gotta go. ####<meld>fear
Ba dum bumb cheshhh! ####<meld>joy
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion. ####<meld>neutral
See? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind". ####<meld>fear
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I should go, too. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there. ####<meld>neutral
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. ####<meld>anger
And she was like "Oh, don't worry! ####<meld>sadness
I asked him. ####<meld>neutral
He's totally ok with seeing you!". ####<meld>anger
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him! ####<meld>joy
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him! ####<meld>anger
Exactly! ####<meld>neutral
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous! ####<meld>neutral
I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh, ####<meld>anger
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, that'll be great! ####<meld>joy
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together. ####<meld>disgust
That's not what we're gonna do! ####<meld>disgust
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'? ####<meld>disgust
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me. ####<meld>joy
Hello Skidmark. ####<meld>neutral
Its a nickname, Ill explain later. ####<meld>neutral
Its pretty clear. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight. ####<meld>neutral
Thats why you broke up with me? ####<meld>surprise
You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done! ####<meld>sadness
Ni-chou chi-ma! ####<meld>joy
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... ####<meld>surprise
Hi everyone. ####<meld>neutral
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey. ####<meld>neutral
What did, what did he say? ####<meld>fear
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. ####<meld>neutral
So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, great! ####<meld>joy
We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. ####<meld>joy
Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly. ####<meld>joy
All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?" ####<meld>joy
And did he? ####<meld>neutral
Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. ####<meld>joy
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it. ####<meld>neutral
I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. ####<meld>joy
Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I? ####<meld>sadness
You sound like a guy. ####<meld>disgust
No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." ####<meld>disgust
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! ####<meld>sadness
Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up! ####<meld>surprise
I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again. ####<meld>sadness
Youll have a last kiss. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you so much for coming back over. ####<meld>joy
Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable. ####<meld>sadness
I know Mona, just hear me out. ####<meld>neutral
First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. ####<meld>neutral
Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that. ####<meld>neutral
Focus. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are ####<meld>neutral
All right wheres that turkey! ####<meld>neutral
Joey! Those are my maternity pants! ####<meld>surprise
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants! ####<meld>joy
No. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Oh, would you look at that Monica? ####<meld>joy
I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad. ####<meld>joy
Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe! ####<meld>anger
Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning. ####<meld>joy
Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game! ####<meld>anger
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work. ####<meld>neutral
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! ####<meld>joy
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! ####<meld>sadness
Or Friday with no two pizzas! ####<meld>sadness
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over. ####<meld>sadness
No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey! ####<meld>joy
All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting? ####<meld>neutral
Thats right! ####<meld>joy
Cause Im a Tribbiani! ####<meld>joy
And this is what we do! ####<meld>neutral
We can eat! ####<meld>joy
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube. ####<meld>surprise
Look at this! ####<meld>joy
Oh! You have a window! ####<meld>surprise
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of... ####<meld>joy
Oh look! That guy's peeing! ####<meld>surprise
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too? ####<meld>anger
Okay. Lets use this brush. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. This stuff? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay-Dokey ####<meld>sadness
Where exactly is your zoo? ####<meld>neutral
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. ####<meld>neutral
Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
Does he, uh, fight with other animals? ####<meld>neutral
No-no, he's, he's very docile. ####<meld>neutral
Even if he were... cornered? ####<meld>neutral
Well I, I don't know. Why? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, how is he at handling small objects? ####<meld>neutral
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean... ####<meld>neutral
How about a hammer, or a small blade? ####<meld>neutral
Otherwise it's just cruel. ####<meld>neutral
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego. ####<meld>joy
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing... ####<meld>neutral
...He's in. ####<meld>neutral
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! ####<meld>joy
You're making a big mistake here. ####<meld>disgust
I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. ####<meld>neutral
My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. ####<meld>neutral
Really helped speed the process along! ####<meld>joy
Janice! ####<meld>surprise
You're not... gone? ####<meld>surprise
Sid is still in his room. ####<meld>neutral
I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. ####<meld>joy
So did you do it? ####<meld>surprise
Did you make your deposit? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over! ####<meld>joy
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results? ####<meld>fear
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok. ####<meld>joy
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, where's your purse? ####<meld>fear
No, no! Give it to me! ####<meld>anger
You can't have it. ####<meld>anger
Give it to me! ####<meld>anger
No ####<meld>anger
I'll go in there. ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah. ####<meld>anger
Phoebe come here ####<meld>neutral
Haha! ####<meld>joy
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing! ####<meld>anger
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial. ####<meld>disgust
I just had sex. ####<meld>neutral
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me? ####<meld>surprise
Well, you never told me how old you were. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking? ####<meld>disgust
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'... ####<meld>joy
Don't say it. ####<meld>fear
...in love with you. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well,fall out of it. ####<meld>anger
You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. ####<meld>anger
Oh god, oh god. ####<meld>joy
I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. ####<meld>disgust
I'm Joan Collins. ####<meld>disgust
Who? ####<meld>neutral
Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room! ####<meld>sadness
Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here? ####<meld>neutral
You. Like you havent done enough. ####<meld>anger
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. ####<meld>neutral
I mean I wish I were a seahorse. ####<meld>neutral
Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies. ####<meld>neutral
And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea. ####<meld>anger
God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life! ####<meld>joy
Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end ####<meld>neutral
Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. ####<meld>neutral
Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea? ####<meld>sadness
Oh God, get out! ####<meld>anger
Get out!! ####<meld>anger
Get out!! ####<meld>anger
Get out! ####<meld>anger
Lets. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now? ####<meld>fear
I cant watch! ####<meld>fear
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Seriously, how can you watch this? ####<meld>sadness
Arent you scared? ####<meld>fear
Terrified. ####<meld>fear
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are! ####<meld>joy
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I ####<meld>neutral
Fine! Maybe I will too! ####<meld>joy
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away. ####<meld>fear
You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away! ####<meld>fear
MY SANDWICH?!!! ####<meld>anger
MY SANDWICH!!!!!! ####<meld>anger
Whats the matter, Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. ####<meld>sadness
Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is. ####<meld>sadness
She knows, and she wont tell me. ####<meld>sadness
Aww Pheebs, that sucks! ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet. ####<meld>sadness
Where ya going? ####<meld>neutral
Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering. ####<meld>fear
Well, are any of those people here?! ####<meld>anger
Oh my God, so do I! ####<meld>surprise
I knew it, wow!! ####<meld>surprise
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, so cute. ####<meld>joy
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you. ####<meld>anger
I know. Im mad at me too. ####<meld>anger
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Me too! ####<meld>surprise
All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, you can do this. ####<meld>neutral
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. ####<meld>neutral
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. ####<meld>neutral
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice. ####<meld>sadness
All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it. ####<meld>anger
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out! ####<meld>surprise
Really?  My God, hes really cute. ####<meld>surprise
Go for it. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, Im engaged! ####<meld>surprise
Im just saying, get his number just in case. ####<meld>neutral
But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill. ####<meld>neutral
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged. ####<meld>joy
Well you should be embarrassed. ####<meld>disgust
I did, but that was really fun. ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler. I sensed it was you. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Unagi. Im always aware. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel? ####<meld>joy
Whats up? ####<meld>neutral
I cant figure out what to make Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes. ####<meld>anger
Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade? ####<meld>fear
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Shed-shed love this. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8. ####<meld>neutral
I made it in the sixth grade. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon. ####<meld>neutral
But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. ####<meld>joy
Wait a minute, I cant give this to her. ####<meld>neutral
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up! ####<meld>anger
He might still show up. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours. ####<meld>anger
Is that all? ####<meld>neutral
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding? ####<meld>sadness
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. ####<meld>neutral
Um, its going to be a small ceremony. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, tiny! ####<meld>surprise
Were not even sure why were having it. ####<meld>neutral
Its actually going to be just family. ####<meld>neutral
Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing ####<meld>surprise
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements. ####<meld>joy
Oh great! What, you brought Joey? ####<meld>joy
Well, I brought the next best thing. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! ####<meld>joy
You're so sweet! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, you're so sweet! ####<meld>joy
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me. ####<meld>surprise
Huh. ####<meld>neutral
Well? Aren't you gonna do something? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh. ####<meld>neutral
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna? ####<meld>anger
Nah. ####<meld>neutral
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something! ####<meld>fear
Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?! ####<meld>anger
No! ####<meld>anger
Do you like car games? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yknow the license plate game? ####<meld>neutral
I ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, Ill play! Ill play! ####<meld>joy
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! ####<meld>anger
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? ####<meld>neutral
I cant figure this out! ####<meld>anger
Its so hard! ####<meld>sadness
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah! ####<meld>sadness
Paper cut! ####<meld>sadness
Now, have you told anyone else? ####<meld>neutral
No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out. ####<meld>neutral
You told me. ####<meld>surprise
Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures. ####<meld>anger
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet. ####<meld>surprise
Me too. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? ####<meld>joy
Oh all right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place. ####<meld>neutral
How rude. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite? ####<meld>surprise
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
The ring is gone! ####<meld>surprise
Ugh. ####<meld>disgust
Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!! ####<meld>neutral
You lost the ring! ####<meld>joy
Youre the worst best man ever! ####<meld>anger
Dude, this isnt funny! ####<meld>anger
What am I gonna do?! ####<meld>fear
I go to bed last night, everythings cool! ####<meld>joy
I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone! ####<meld>fear
You slept with the stripper? ####<meld>surprise
Of course!! ####<meld>fear
What difference does that make?! ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference! ####<meld>anger
Joey, do you have a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Dude, what am I gonna ####<meld>fear
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. ####<meld>anger
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem! ####<meld>fear
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have ####<meld>neutral
What-what is it, what is it? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone. ####<meld>surprise
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know! ####<meld>fear
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable! ####<meld>anger
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone! ####<meld>disgust
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they? ####<meld>surprise
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! ####<meld>disgust
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone ####<meld>fear
I'm not listening to you! ####<meld>anger
Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it! ####<meld>joy
Hey, come on now! ####<meld>anger
All right, what are we havin? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation. ####<meld>neutral
Ill take those to go.  For the kids. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there? ####<meld>neutral
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said. ####<meld>anger
But believe me, thats not gonna happen today. ####<meld>neutral
Understood. So, whatd you say back then? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I said that I ####<meld>neutral
Ha! ####<meld>neutral
So you like the drums! ####<meld>joy
That's, that's great! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. ####<meld>neutral
All right, okay, well, apparently not! ####<meld>sadness
So, yay! ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four... ####<meld>neutral
Tequila!! ####<meld>joy
That's fun. ####<meld>joy
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. ####<meld>sadness
Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson. ####<meld>anger
Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it. ####<meld>fear
Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed. ####<meld>anger
All right thats it, school is in session! ####<meld>neutral
My God! Is this a gym card? ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times. ####<meld>neutral
So why dont you quit? ####<meld>neutral
You dont think Ive tried? You think I ####<meld>joy
Who is Maria? ####<meld>neutral
Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat. ####<meld>joy
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
So youre strong enough to face her on your own? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, youll have to come. ####<meld>fear
Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that. ####<meld>neutral
Exactly! Because it's in the past! ####<meld>anger
Anybody gonna eat that? ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear! ####<meld>surprise
I know. They were mine. ####<meld>neutral
Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird! ####<meld>disgust
No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on. ####<meld>neutral
Thats weird! ####<meld>disgust
Im wearing his briefs right now. ####<meld>neutral
Thatskinda hot. ####<meld>surprise
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I wouldnt know about that. ####<meld>neutral
And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin. ####<meld>joy
Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture! ####<meld>disgust
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys. ####<meld>disgust
Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear! ####<meld>neutral
I dont think you could ever do that. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! I ####<meld>neutral
Okay, whatever. ####<meld>disgust
Lusts of the flesh. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know.  A cowboy theme? ####<meld>neutral
Hey uh, is it okay to come in? ####<meld>neutral
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it! ####<meld>joy
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast? ####<meld>neutral
It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen. ####<meld>neutral
Yowza ####<meld>anger
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth. ####<meld>neutral
Dear Lord. ####<meld>surprise
I’m sorry honey, what were you saying? ####<meld>neutral
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that… ####<meld>neutral
Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth? ####<meld>neutral
She looks scared. ####<meld>neutral
Doesn’t she  look scared? ####<meld>neutral
Y’know, I don’t really know her. ####<meld>neutral
Can you see my nipples through this shirt? ####<meld>neutral
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there. ####<meld>neutral
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo." ####<meld>neutral
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... ####<meld>sadness
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. ####<meld>anger
The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a... ####<meld>anger
Pathetic mess? ####<meld>neutral
I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. ####<meld>neutral
I'm thinkin', cha-ching! ####<meld>joy
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. ####<meld>neutral
You're doin' this. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. She said yes. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh? ####<meld>joy
"Happy birthday to you!" ####<meld>joy
Youre paying for that. ####<meld>neutral
What? No-no its her birthday! ####<meld>surprise
Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today! ####<meld>surprise
But it really ####<meld>neutral
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins. ####<meld>neutral
Damnit! ####<meld>anger
Rach? Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Did you tell your sister to ask me out? ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow! ####<meld>surprise
I mean, wow! ####<meld>surprise
I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never! ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!" ####<meld>joy
Oh so-so not really never. ####<meld>neutral
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. ####<meld>neutral
I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-ho, and mine! ####<meld>joy
No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me. ####<meld>fear
WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself? ####<meld>sadness
Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist! ####<meld>sadness
Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
I-Im sorry? ####<meld>sadness
No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist! ####<meld>sadness
Oh yeah? ####<meld>sadness
I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. ####<meld>neutral
Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk. ####<meld>sadness
Hang-hang on. ####<meld>neutral
Hey everybody! ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Im gonna kill myself! ####<meld>sadness
I got nothing. ####<meld>neutral
Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! ####<meld>surprise
I didnt know he could get me fired! ####<meld>surprise
What am I going to do? ####<meld>fear
Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here. ####<meld>fear
No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass! ####<meld>neutral
Thats not a bad idea. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. ####<meld>neutral
Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. ####<meld>joy
So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, you wish. ####<meld>neutral
"You wish." ####<meld>joy
Why are you yelling? ####<meld>joy
Whoa, that ####<meld>neutral
Whoa-whoa, what is it? ####<meld>surprise
Well Its a date. ####<meld>neutral
A date?! ####<meld>surprise
No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend! ####<meld>surprise
Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this. ####<meld>sadness
No, Im gonna!! ####<meld>anger
Thats right! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl! ####<meld>anger
Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! ####<meld>anger
And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing! ####<meld>anger
ThatIts not the same thing! This is ####<meld>anger
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too! ####<meld>anger

Oh yeah, Id love that. ####<meld>joy
Oh, great! Me too. ####<meld>joy
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. ####<meld>neutral
And why do you care so much? ####<meld>neutral
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy! ####<meld>joy
You had fantasies about Emily? ####<meld>sadness
No! Yknow, ####<meld>neutral
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid? ####<meld>neutral

Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed. ####<meld>neutral
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. ####<meld>joy

Okay to come in? ####<meld>neutral

Yeah I know, guess who beeped him? ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Im the ruptured spleen. ####<meld>sadness
Why would you do that? ####<meld>joy
Because you shouldnt be with him.  You should be with me. ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise
When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! ####<meld>sadness
Look, things like last night they dont just happen. ####<meld>neutral
Or at least not to me. ####<meld>neutral
Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! ####<meld>surprise
I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor" ####<meld>sadness
There was just one woman, wasnt there? ####<meld>neutral
No, there were two. ####<meld>neutral
Including me? ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy

Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker? ####<meld>disgust
Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had. ####<meld>surprise
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid. ####<meld>sadness
Im your mother. ####<meld>neutral
Ehh? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler... ####<meld>neutral
Hi there. ####<meld>neutral
...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really know what happened with that either. ####<meld>neutral
And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. ####<meld>neutral
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either... ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment? ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah, I lied before. ####<meld>sadness

HowHow small are your feet? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Im-Im saving this for my friend Ross. ####<meld>neutral
You mean Dr. Geller? ####<meld>neutral
Doctor? Wow! I didnt know he had a nickname. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, he wont sit here. ####<meld>neutral
Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize. ####<meld>sadness
Oh yeah man.  Joey. ####<meld>neutral

A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished. ####<meld>neutral
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet. ####<meld>joy
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me. ####<meld>neutral
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum? ####<meld>neutral

No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. ####<meld>anger
It-it-its no big deal, all right, Im-Im cool. ####<meld>fear
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes! ####<meld>sadness
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck. ####<meld>disgust
Oh God! ####<meld>sadness
So, how many have you sold so far? ####<meld>neutral
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God, how did you do that? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! ####<meld>joy
Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. ####<meld>joy
I am selling cookies by the case. ####<meld>joy
They call me: 'Cookie Dude!' ####<meld>joy
Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers..... ####<meld>neutral

The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them? ####<meld>surprise
No you didnt. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. ####<meld>neutral
And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? ####<meld>neutral
Why not a Yugoslavian?" ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, then you did that. ####<meld>neutral
So you dont have the cameras?! ####<meld>surprise
No. Sorry man. ####<meld>sadness
So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak! ####<meld>surprise
Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel. Ill-Ill help you look for them. ####<meld>neutral
Great. ####<meld>anger

This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is notthats-thats not what it is. ####<meld>joy
See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. ####<meld>neutral
Its-its, theyre-theyre wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at ####<meld>neutral
Maybe in L.A? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! ####<meld>joy
There you go. ####<meld>neutral
So, have you kids eaten yet? ####<meld>neutral
Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next. ####<meld>neutral

Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin around the house. ####<meld>neutral
So We go eat. ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
Youll wear that. Well be eating, and of course, youll be wearing that. ####<meld>neutral
Well I guess I shouldve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller! ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Enough! ####<meld>anger
Lean lean lean ####<meld>joy
Let me see that. ####<meld>neutral
This one right here. ####<meld>neutral
Triskaidekaphobia. ####<meld>neutral
The fear of ####<meld>neutral

Its possible, they have really sharp edges. ####<meld>neutral
All right Chandler, youre up. ####<meld>neutral
Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn? ####<meld>joy
This game makes no sense! ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing. ####<meld>joy
Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here. ####<meld>neutral
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card. ####<meld>neutral
Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care. ####<meld>anger
You-you must choose Mr. Bing. ####<meld>neutral
Either, it makes no difference. ####<meld>neutral
Choose, you jackass! ####<meld>anger
Ill take a card. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points! ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
This game is kinda fun. ####<meld>joy
You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you ####<meld>neutral
I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other. ####<meld>neutral
Hello?  Oh, hi Ross!  See? Other people call me! ####<meld>surprise
Very funny Ross! ####<meld>joy

"Oh, my, god." ####<meld>surprise
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!" ####<meld>joy
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise. ####<meld>neutral
We won. We won! ####<meld>joy
Mr. Heckles. ####<meld>neutral
How did this happen? ####<meld>neutral
He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand. ####<meld>neutral
That's terrible. ####<meld>anger
I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me. ####<meld>neutral
Sure, you coulda. You never know. ####<meld>neutral
You never know. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Where's Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, he needed some time to grieve. ####<meld>neutral
I'm free! I'm free! ####<meld>joy
That oughta do it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning. ####<meld>sadness
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning? ####<meld>surprise
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale. ####<meld>neutral
I didn't know there were docks. ####<meld>surprise
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, is it broken? ####<meld>sadness
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. ####<meld>joy
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed? ####<meld>neutral
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out. ####<meld>sadness
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket. ####<meld>anger
What is this? Fruit? ####<meld>surprise
Monica's making jam. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place? ####<meld>joy
Because the kids need new shoes. ####<meld>neutral
I'm going into business people. ####<meld>neutral
I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. ####<meld>neutral
I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. ####<meld>anger
What's the opposite of man? ####<meld>neutral
Jam. ####<meld>neutral
Oh Joey don't! ####<meld>fear
It's way to hot. ####<meld>anger
This will just be my batch. ####<meld>neutral
Why? Do you think hes still mad at us? ####<meld>surprise
Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles. ####<meld>neutral
What? Mine arent tinted. ####<meld>surprise
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? ####<meld>neutral
I will have one. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im not gonna have one. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, its just my tooth. ####<meld>sadness
All right Ill have one. ####<meld>neutral
So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one. ####<meld>neutral
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him. ####<meld>fear
See that is the problem with invisible dentists. ####<meld>neutral
Why? Why cant you go to him? ####<meld>surprise
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies. ####<meld>anger
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob. ####<meld>neutral
And all these people actually died? ####<meld>surprise
Yes, while I was in the chair! ####<meld>sadness
Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives! ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. ####<meld>neutral
Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence. ####<meld>neutral
Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead. ####<meld>sadness
Hello? ####<meld>surprise
Ross. ####<meld>neutral
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things. ####<meld>sadness
No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called. ####<meld>joy
Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else. ####<meld>joy
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America? ####<meld>sadness
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. ####<meld>sadness
So, let's go. ####<meld>neutral
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now. ####<meld>neutral
You know, the guys are probably having a great time. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ive got three of my five. ####<meld>neutral
Three of your five, what? ####<meld>neutral
Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left. ####<meld>neutral
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely.... ####<meld>joy
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving. ####<meld>surprise
Susan Sarandon. ####<meld>neutral
Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first. ####<meld>disgust
And!! Isabella Rosselini. ####<meld>joy
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around. ####<meld>joy
So? ####<meld>neutral
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out? ####<meld>sadness
Yknow what I think it is? ####<meld>neutral
I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! ####<meld>sadness
Twenty-one hours, youre a hero. ####<meld>neutral
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out. ####<meld>sadness
Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom. ####<meld>neutral
My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker! ####<meld>surprise
Are they here yet? ####<meld>neutral
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok? ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
May I see your boarding pass? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass. ####<meld>neutral
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. ####<meld>neutral
He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just... ####<meld>sadness
No no no! Federal regulations! ####<meld>anger

Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide between the two of them. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. ####<meld>neutral
But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes ####<meld>neutral
If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
She lives so close. ####<meld>neutral
And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny. ####<meld>neutral
On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist. ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant? ####<meld>joy
Damn! ####<meld>joy
Oh heres a whole bunch. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." ####<meld>neutral
Then shell have to come back here and live all alone. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant.  So I guess she wont be totally alone. ####<meld>surprise
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger. ####<meld>sadness
It really wasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think youll really enjoy. ####<meld>anger
Now, this is just a loan. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Im gonna, Im gonna want him back. ####<meld>neutral
So  Im gonna go now. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant! ####<meld>sadness
All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?! ####<meld>sadness
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. ####<meld>neutral
All right ladies, heres what were gonna do. ####<meld>neutral
I-I wanna be with her,  I like her. ####<meld>anger
Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts. ####<meld>joy
Wait, now, what am I doing again? ####<meld>surprise
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment! ####<meld>anger
Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no, that not Joshua. ####<meld>anger
What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy. ####<meld>surprise
So anyway, Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay,  but the rest of us have a ####<meld>sadness
How do I look? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, now, remember, no trading. ####<meld>neutral
You get the pretty one, I get the mess. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice. ####<meld>joy
...And what did you bring? ####<meld>neutral
She's checking the coats. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. ####<meld>neutral
Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. ####<meld>neutral
Janice? ####<meld>surprise
Oh.... my.... God. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, it's Janice. ####<meld>neutral
Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please? ####<meld>anger
Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?! ####<meld>sadness
Hey Rach! ####<meld>anger
What was that?! ####<meld>surprise
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie? ####<meld>neutral
I havent seen it yet! ####<meld>neutral
Well then youd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! ####<meld>surprise
No ####<meld>anger
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Uh, okay, Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?! ####<meld>anger
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, all of us! All day! ####<meld>joy
That sucks! ####<meld>disgust
That's not a trip! ####<meld>surprise
I just came from the park! ####<meld>anger
What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? ####<meld>anger
"Well, it's right by my house, all right!" ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. ####<meld>anger
Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! ####<meld>surprise
Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it! ####<meld>anger
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group. ####<meld>sadness
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth. ####<meld>disgust
Makes me wanna puke! ####<meld>disgust
Is she in there? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her. ####<meld>neutral
Oh its all right. ####<meld>neutral
Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing. ####<meld>sadness
Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different. ####<meld>sadness
This is hard. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah I know. ####<meld>neutral
On the other hand in um, in about seven months youre gonna have something that youre gonna love more than any guy youve ever gone out with. ####<meld>neutral
Just wait. ####<meld>neutral
Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. ####<meld>joy
You have no idea. ####<meld>joy
Thanks sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, I think Im gonna go home and eat ten candy bars. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, I thought I cheered you up. ####<meld>neutral
Oh you did, there are twenty in here. ####<meld>neutral
Right. Good night. ####<meld>neutral
Good night. ####<meld>neutral
Hi ####<meld>neutral
Hi!  Hey mom. ####<meld>joy
This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom? ####<meld>joy
Jack? ####<meld>surprise
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? ####<meld>surprise
Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question ####<meld>neutral
Congratulations you two! ####<meld>joy
Thank youwere so excited ####<meld>joy
And also, congratulations on your wedding. ####<meld>joy
WhaWhat? ####<meld>surprise
Look at this clown! ####<meld>joy
Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. ####<meld>disgust
Get out of the way jackass! ####<meld>anger
Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway? ####<meld>disgust
That ####<meld>neutral
What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>anger
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! ####<meld>surprise
Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?! ####<meld>neutral
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Really?! Well, its just like everyone elses apartment. Its got rooms, walls, and ceilings. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Ah well, this is the living room. ####<meld>neutral
All right. This is the kitchen. ####<meld>neutral
The bedroom. Well its pretty much your typical...  bedroom. ####<meld>neutral
Were still on this side of the door. ####<meld>neutral
Ha-ha ####<meld>joy
Yeah, but I didnt get to see it. ####<meld>sadness
Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening. ####<meld>neutral
So um, who was she? ####<meld>joy
Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today. ####<meld>neutral
Did you like her? And Im just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you seem fine. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont think this, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird. ####<meld>disgust
Yeah, no, Ill get one of the other girls to do it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, this will be so much fun! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Are you excited? ####<meld>joy
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine. ####<meld>neutral
All I have is, is oregano and a ####<meld>neutral
Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man. ####<meld>joy
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place. ####<meld>neutral
Can we just start throwing things in? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah. ####<meld>neutral
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked. ####<meld>neutral
Hey he's wearing a sweater. ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Eww! ####<meld>disgust
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure... ####<meld>neutral
Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? ####<meld>neutral
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, its okay. ####<meld>neutral
No, its still wet. ####<meld>joy
Let me get it out before it sets. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, I have something you can wear. ####<meld>neutral
Here. ####<meld>neutral
Oh umm, I-I dont know if I want to wear a womans shirt. ####<meld>sadness
No-no thats a mans shirt. ####<meld>neutral
Its awfully pink. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, it's perfect! ####<meld>joy
How about you? ####<meld>neutral
It's a kitchen slash bathroom. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application. ####<meld>neutral
We are bad people. ####<meld>disgust
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen? ####<meld>surprise
Lets get the show on it! ####<meld>joy
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close. ####<meld>neutral
Closer than here? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, lets skedaddle. ####<meld>neutral
Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, your highness. ####<meld>neutral
Um, Rachel Im really sorry.  Thats okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?! ####<meld>surprise
So how did you know I was even here? ####<meld>surprise
Your mom called me. So is this her? ####<meld>neutral
No, this is a loaner. ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. ####<meld>neutral
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, they're not so bad. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im ####<meld>neutral
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour. ####<meld>surprise
Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely. ####<meld>sadness
All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong. ####<meld>fear
I just called a friend of mine. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
I think I may be able to book ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
What is it sweetie? ####<meld>joy
Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry daddy. ####<meld>sadness
I dont believe this!! ####<meld>neutral
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please. ####<meld>fear
Stay calm?!! ####<meld>anger
How do you expect me to stay calm?! ####<meld>anger
This is unacceptable Rachel! ####<meld>anger
And I wanna know why?!! ####<meld>anger
Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?! ####<meld>anger
Thats it! ####<meld>anger
Is that it? ####<meld>anger
Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods. ####<meld>sadness
So, youre like a zillionaire? ####<meld>surprise
And youre our age. Youre our age. ####<meld>surprise
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself. ####<meld>neutral
What like Pete Dakota? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago. ####<meld>neutral
Thats not a state Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is? ####<meld>neutral
I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Youre our age! ####<meld>surprise
So ah, we on for tomorrow? ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Now get out of here you!! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him! ####<meld>anger
Look, is there something wrong with me? ####<meld>sadness
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future? ####<meld>sadness
Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on! ####<meld>sadness
I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me? ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im gonna go get Frank. ####<meld>neutral
So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember? ####<meld>neutral
And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? ####<meld>neutral
You know what else Im not gonna miss? ####<meld>anger
"Im Monica. ####<meld>anger
I wash the toilet 17 times a day. ####<meld>anger
Even if people are on it!" ####<meld>anger
"Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!" ####<meld>anger
"Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!" ####<meld>anger
Hey! I call her! ####<meld>joy
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!" ####<meld>anger
"Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend! ####<meld>anger
So I guess Ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!" ####<meld>anger
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. ####<meld>neutral
Item J437-A, color: winterberry. ####<meld>neutral
Hi umm, listen come here, come in. ####<meld>neutral
Im so-so sorry about yesterday. ####<meld>sadness
I-Im really sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Its just that I ####<meld>joy
Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there. ####<meld>neutral
You do? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, you still have feelings for me. ####<meld>sadness
And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. ####<meld>joy
And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant. ####<meld>sadness
Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be. ####<meld>sadness
Oh God youre right. ####<meld>joy
Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you? ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>neutral
Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it. ####<meld>neutral
Gimme this. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist. ####<meld>neutral
Brides magazines? ####<meld>surprise
Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing. ####<meld>sadness
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. ####<meld>surprise
I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant. ####<meld>joy
Right? ####<meld>joy
I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
I know.  I need more pie. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests? ####<meld>neutral
You didnt break up with that fireman? ####<meld>surprise
No, that was my way of telling you. ####<meld>neutral
Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. ####<meld>neutral
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal. ####<meld>neutral
So then, are you going to dump Jason? ####<meld>neutral
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know? ####<meld>neutral
So Its really just about the math. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, look! Enough is enough! ####<meld>anger
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him! ####<meld>joy
Monica, that was also true an ####<meld>neutral
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours! ####<meld>anger
You knew this about me when you married me! ####<meld>neutral
You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. ####<meld>neutral
Well, this is my sickness! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah me too, all night. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! How come we didnt cross paths? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper. ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there! ####<meld>surprise
Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone. ####<meld>neutral
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy! ####<meld>disgust
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! ####<meld>anger
So. ####<meld>neutral
So. ####<meld>neutral
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you know, we've never really talked. ####<meld>neutral
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right? ####<meld>neutral
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. ####<meld>fear
Really? Me? ####<meld>surprise
Oh my god, are you kidding? ####<meld>surprise
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't. ####<meld>anger
Well, you're not totally paranoid. ####<meld>neutral
Oy. ####<meld>joy
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right. ####<meld>sadness
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it. ####<meld>joy
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later. ####<meld>neutral
All right, Julie. ####<meld>neutral
Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Bye.  What a manipulative bitch. ####<meld>disgust
Chandler, I found the perfect ring. ####<meld>joy
Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over! ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail! ####<meld>sadness
They put you in jail? ####<meld>surprise
The little jail between the doors! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring! ####<meld>anger
I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring. ####<meld>anger
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps. ####<meld>sadness
Maybe it was the guy. ####<meld>neutral
It was the ring! ####<meld>anger
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy? ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her. ####<meld>neutral
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. ####<meld>anger
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.. ####<meld>surprise
We can, we can go to Aruba! ####<meld>joy
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. ####<meld>sadness
You would've liked it. ####<meld>sadness
I had a bra. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Dr. Farber. ####<meld>neutral
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid. ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! What does ####<meld>surprise
Oh that's an eye removal machine. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I'm outta here! ####<meld>anger
I'm kidding! I'm kidding! ####<meld>joy
So were done then! ####<meld>anger
Almost! But first, we gotta start. ####<meld>neutral
This is a glaucoma test. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Sit down. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
A small puff of air, now come on! ####<meld>anger
Sure, now Im scared. ####<meld>fear
No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but I dont wanna die! ####<meld>fear
No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys! ####<meld>joy
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step. ####<meld>neutral
Youre building a post office? ####<meld>surprise
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  My word! Those are snug. ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes. ####<meld>neutral
Power saw kinda got away from me there. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again! ####<meld>anger
So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem? ####<meld>neutral
I cant seem to say goodbye. ####<meld>sadness
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more? ####<meld>surprise
Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?! ####<meld>anger
It was cheesecake. ####<meld>neutral
It was fine. ####<meld>neutral
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow! ####<meld>surprise
My whole mouth just filled with saliva! ####<meld>joy
Yknow what? Forget it! ####<meld>anger
Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted. ####<meld>neutral
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch? ####<meld>neutral
Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. ####<meld>neutral
This ones from me. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh! ####<meld>surprise
It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun. ####<meld>neutral
A scooter! ####<meld>surprise
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list. ####<meld>neutral
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys? ####<meld>neutral
For my last birthday you gave me a ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Happy birthday Grandma! ####<meld>joy
Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it. ####<meld>neutral
All our love Monica and Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Thats funny, yeah! ####<meld>joy
No-no-no-no! That was the joke! ####<meld>surprise
No, I know! I get it! Its funny! ####<meld>joy
No, because youre not a grandmother! ####<meld>sadness
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things. ####<meld>sadness
Thats why its so funny. ####<meld>neutral
All you had to do was buy the card! ####<meld>anger
Hey, Joey. What's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. ####<meld>neutral
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?! ####<meld>disgust
Sorry. Wrong boobies. ####<meld>sadness
Hello, Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! ...Hello, dear. ####<meld>surprise
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? ####<meld>surprise

Really? ####<meld>surprise
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. ####<meld>disgust
Hey, buddy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that's attractive. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. ####<meld>joy
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? ####<meld>disgust
Oh, ah- the kid has it. ####<meld>neutral
The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck. ####<meld>anger
You gotta do it, man. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck. ####<meld>anger

Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! ####<meld>anger

Oh, look, wish me luck! ####<meld>joy
What for? ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna go get one of those  job things. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right? ####<meld>neutral
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate! ####<meld>anger
What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green! ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Im so glad you could make it. ####<meld>joy
Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it. ####<meld>joy
Try. Theres my little girl. ####<meld>joy
Shes still mad. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay. ####<meld>neutral
Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself. ####<meld>joy
Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross? ####<meld>neutral
No, I dont think well be doing that. ####<meld>disgust
Were not gonna do that. ####<meld>disgust
Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare. ####<meld>neutral
Am I interrupting? ####<meld>neutral
Uh yes! Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Oh. Oh wait no. ####<meld>neutral
Later. ####<meld>neutral
Oh uh, Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father! ####<meld>fear
Try feeding her again. ####<meld>neutral
I already fed her. ####<meld>neutral
I know, that’s why I said again! ####<meld>anger
Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants. ####<meld>fear
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh. ####<meld>joy
Oh Monica, we are so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
For what? ####<meld>joy
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower. ####<meld>sadness
And then for forgetting to invite you to it. ####<meld>neutral
You al-you already had it? ####<meld>surprise
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either. ####<meld>sadness
We ruined everything. ####<meld>sadness
Ugh ####<meld>sadness
Well no, wait a minute, thats not true! ####<meld>sadness
No, what did, that was really sweet. ####<meld>joy
And it kinda works out for the best. ####<meld>joy
What do you, what do you mean? ####<meld>surprise
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! ####<meld>joy
I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like! ####<meld>joy
Surprise ####<meld>sadness
Surprise ####<meld>joy
Monica. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!! ####<meld>anger
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. ####<meld>neutral
Not you guys. ####<meld>neutral
You got it going on! ####<meld>joy
So, what are we gonna do today? ####<meld>neutral
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play! ####<meld>surprise
I don't think so! ####<meld>joy
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying! ####<meld>neutral
I'm not always that bad! ####<meld>neutral
Oh, ####<meld>neutral
I punched you...? ####<meld>surprise
And...? ####<meld>surprise
... Phoebe...? ####<meld>surprise
... and...? ####<meld>neutral
I clunked your heads together! ####<meld>neutral
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire. ####<meld>sadness
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room. ####<meld>neutral
All right. Did everyone get out okay? ####<meld>fear
Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh. What is this? ####<meld>surprise
No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!! ####<meld>fear
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets! ####<meld>sadness
Hey! How long until Petes fight? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. ####<meld>neutral
Hot dog? ####<meld>neutral
Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you. ####<meld>fear
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie? ####<meld>neutral
I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, thats too bad! ####<meld>sadness
No, I-Im saying I liked her. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea. ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again. ####<meld>joy
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else? ####<meld>disgust
Hey! Which ones my turkey burger? ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, the fights starting! ####<meld>joy
Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today? ####<meld>neutral
Nine times! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I had to put on lotion! ####<meld>neutral
But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free. ####<meld>neutral
Fights over! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before. ####<meld>surprise
Hi guys! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
What are you up too? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, Big Brother. ####<meld>neutral
Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? ####<meld>neutral
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world! ####<meld>anger
Eh ####<meld>neutral
Okay well thats good to know. ####<meld>sadness
The Mr. Bowmonts here!!! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business. ####<meld>joy
Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie. ####<meld>neutral
My friends name is Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Apparently Howies editing now. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. ####<meld>anger
Can you believe that?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie. ####<meld>disgust
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first! ####<meld>disgust
The nerve huh? ####<meld>disgust
Yeah! ####<meld>disgust
Refill? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! How you doing? ####<meld>joy
Good! Good, long time no see. ####<meld>joy
Like your sweater. ####<meld>neutral
Oh hey, right back at ya. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady? ####<meld>surprise
So whose is it? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
He is so weird. ####<meld>anger
You wanna fool around with Joey? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head! ####<meld>joy
And what's the big deal, people do it all the time! ####<meld>surprise
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around? ####<meld>surprise
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet. ####<meld>neutral
Who, who are they? ####<meld>neutral
I know them from work. ####<meld>neutral
Both of them? ####<meld>surprise
No, one of them... ####<meld>neutral
Which one? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, what were the names I just said? ####<meld>neutral
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated. ####<meld>anger
All right, all right, you're right ####<meld>sadness
What the hell are you cooking! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God! How did you get back here?! ####<meld>surprise
Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you? ####<meld>surprise
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute. ####<meld>anger
Thats not mine. ####<meld>neutral
Yes it is. ####<meld>neutral
How do you know? ####<meld>fear
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica." ####<meld>disgust
Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America! ####<meld>anger
Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them. ####<meld>neutral
Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off! ####<meld>anger
Theres a reset button under the plastic cover. ####<meld>neutral
Theres a reset button?! ####<meld>surprise
My God! ####<meld>surprise
Why didnt I see that! ####<meld>surprise
Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? ####<meld>neutral
Oh here it is! ####<meld>joy
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, God! ####<meld>joy
Four letters: "Circle or hoop". ####<meld>neutral
Ring dammit, ring! ####<meld>anger
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you know our phone's not working? ####<meld>surprise
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer. ####<meld>neutral
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off! ####<meld>anger
Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone? ####<meld>anger
Nngghhh!!!!!!! ####<meld>anger
Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please. ####<meld>neutral
"Heating device." ####<meld>neutral
Radiator. ####<meld>neutral
Five letters. ####<meld>neutral
Rdtor. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman. ####<meld>surprise
Well, you'll have to wait your turn. ####<meld>neutral
Well, how long do you think it'll be? ####<meld>neutral
Any minute now. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, this-  Heyy... ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Any good mail? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda. ####<meld>neutral
"Benefits lapsed." ####<meld>neutral
Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year. ####<meld>neutral
Let me see that! ####<meld>surprise
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I cant believe this! ####<meld>surprise
This sucks! ####<meld>anger
When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? ####<meld>fear
And it wouldnt matter. ####<meld>anger
Now I gotta be careful? ####<meld>anger
Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire. ####<meld>sadness
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street. ####<meld>neutral
look both ways before you cross the street. ####<meld>joy
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies! ####<meld>surprise
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing. ####<meld>joy
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex. ####<meld>neutral
Do you know anything about women? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
That's all right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. He could row like a viking. ####<meld>joy
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Mmm. ####<meld>neutral
So how'd it go? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, y'know.. ####<meld>neutral
Did he mention us? ####<meld>neutral
He said he's really gonna miss you guys. ####<meld>sadness
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. ####<meld>sadness
...love you. ####<meld>joy
Are you're hands still wet? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, moist, yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Let's dry 'em again. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Oh my God!! ####<meld>sadness
Still crying? ####<meld>surprise
Like a ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex. ####<meld>neutral
Whats the other one? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one. ####<meld>neutral
Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats right. ####<meld>joy
Youre the talker. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway uh, great idea! ####<meld>joy
Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, we have some ####<meld>neutral
No you dont! ####<meld>anger
Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, what town are we near? ####<meld>neutral
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg? ####<meld>neutral
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on? ####<meld>anger
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, no they dont do that. ####<meld>neutral
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us. ####<meld>neutral
Who? ####<meld>anger
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? ####<meld>fear
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up. ####<meld>neutral
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here! ####<meld>anger
But if... ####<meld>fear
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else. ####<meld>anger
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back. ####<meld>joy
So the going for help went well? ####<meld>neutral
Im telling you man, I saw it. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong. ####<meld>anger
Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh? ####<meld>sadness
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Lets try a lookof far offwonderment. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come. ####<meld>joy
Chandler! ####<meld>surprise
What is the matter with your face?! ####<meld>surprise
I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>anger
Dont laugh at him! ####<meld>anger
Hes ####<meld>neutral
Were gonna find love! ####<meld>joy
Definitely! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Im pretty confident about that. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! ####<meld>joy
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though. ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean? ####<meld>neutral
Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other. ####<meld>neutral
You mean a backup? ####<meld>neutral
Exactly! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, yeah I got that. ####<meld>neutral
You do? ####<meld>neutral
Hm-mmm ####<meld>neutral
Who? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I locked him years ago! ####<meld>joy
Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey. ####<meld>surprise
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, seriously? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Good morning. ####<meld>neutral
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night? ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game. ####<meld>joy
Ohh thats nice. ####<meld>joy
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women! ####<meld>joy
Wo-women? You mean like old women? ####<meld>disgust
Well kinda old, like 30. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night. ####<meld>surprise
Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh? ####<meld>surprise
A little. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
How you doin? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing! ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
So does it really hurt as bad as they say? ####<meld>joy
What did you just say? ####<meld>surprise
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight. ####<meld>joy
Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you. ####<meld>joy
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! ####<meld>joy
What do you say? ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right! ####<meld>joy
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one? ####<meld>anger
It went under the table. ####<meld>neutral
Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way! ####<meld>anger
Here it is! Here it is! ####<meld>joy
That could be a four or a five. It's your call. ####<meld>neutral
It's a four. ####<meld>neutral
I think so too. ####<meld>neutral
Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats. ####<meld>joy
Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you. ####<meld>joy
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now. ####<meld>neutral
Is there anything we can do for you? ####<meld>neutral
No just, nobody press on my stomach. ####<meld>neutral
You can keep those pants by the way. ####<meld>neutral
Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, you want some? ####<meld>neutral
Ah, just cut me a little sliver. ####<meld>joy
A little bigger. ####<meld>neutral
Little bigger. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Are you afraid youre gonna run out?! ####<meld>anger
Cut me a real piece! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Of course, of course. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, do you know each others hometowns? ####<meld>neutral
Why dont you   Wh-whats going on? ####<meld>fear
Well, umm, not much. ####<meld>neutral
But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
So, could I just move in with you for a couple days? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing..Why? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, you said it was urgent! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students? ####<meld>anger
Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies? ####<meld>neutral
Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this. ####<meld>sadness
Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you. ####<meld>fear
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. ####<meld>sadness
Your good heart Rach,  and, and.... ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>neutral
I cant, youre a totally different person to me now. ####<meld>sadness
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. ####<meld>sadness
God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. ####<meld>sadness
Its just changed, everything. ####<meld>sadness
Forever. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean. ####<meld>sadness
Then how come it is? ####<meld>sadness
Windows are clean, candels are lit. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. ####<meld>joy
Did I turn the fish? ####<meld>neutral
No, cause I made lasagne. ####<meld>neutral
Am I out of control? ####<meld>anger
Just a touch. ####<meld>neutral
Mon, I don't understand. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? ####<meld>surprise
I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Could tonight be the Night? ####<meld>joy
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. ####<meld>joy
Things happen, and they happen. ####<meld>joy
You don't plan these things. ####<meld>neutral
So, did you shave your legs? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! ####<meld>anger
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear
Is there a problem? ####<meld>neutral
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. ####<meld>neutral
But that's okay, no problem. ####<meld>neutral
No problem. ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, noodle soup. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup." ####<meld>neutral
Oh, what did I say? ####<meld>surprise
Hmm, noodle soup. ####<meld>neutral
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah! ####<meld>surprise
All right, let's try one. ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, noodle soup. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Let's do it again. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup! ####<meld>anger
COME ON!!!! ####<meld>anger
Y'know what? We need to move on. ####<meld>anger
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Give her some money. ####<meld>neutral
I really think theyre out of rooms. ####<meld>neutral
Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?! ####<meld>anger
Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up? ####<meld>neutral
This is a hospital. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Id have to say I really dont care for your tone. ####<meld>anger
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa! ####<meld>anger
Oh gosh! ####<meld>surprise
What-what? ####<meld>surprise
Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow! ####<meld>surprise
Would you like to see a semi-private room? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look. ####<meld>neutral
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half. ####<meld>neutral
That's funny. Who are they? ####<meld>joy
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend. ####<meld>neutral
You mean they're lovers. ####<meld>surprise
If you wanna put a label on it. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, uh, anything else I should know? ####<meld>surprise
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, quick and painful. ####<meld>neutral

Hi Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
How are ya? ####<meld>neutral
Good. ####<meld>neutral
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?! ####<meld>anger
Ooh, now you lost me. ####<meld>fear
You stole the phone! ####<meld>anger
No I didnt! ####<meld>anger
No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring? ####<meld>anger
No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work! ####<meld>fear
Phoebe! ####<meld>anger
Its not here. ####<meld>neutral
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there? ####<meld>neutral
How could I have left them in the copy room? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please. ####<meld>anger
Fine. ####<meld>anger
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya! ####<meld>joy
This will be your phone. ####<meld>neutral
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls. ####<meld>neutral
No you answer it and take pledges. ####<meld>neutral
But I'm the host! ####<meld>surprise
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones. ####<meld>neutral
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray. ####<meld>neutral
Well, here's your phone doctor. ####<meld>neutral
Hey guys. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs? ####<meld>surprise
Well, hes very charming. ####<meld>neutral
I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him. ####<meld>disgust
Well, youre just gonna have to try. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, where are the ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin em around... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go. ####<meld>anger
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! ####<meld>joy
Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break? ####<meld>surprise
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price? ####<meld>joy
I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband. ####<meld>joy
Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots. ####<meld>sadness
Come on more! ####<meld>anger
Oh God! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, you like that dont you? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah right there! ####<meld>joy
You want it there? You take it there baby! ####<meld>joy
Uh Phoebe? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now Im going to cover you back up, and umm were never doing this again. ####<meld>joy
Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy? ####<meld>anger
Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! ####<meld>anger
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! ####<meld>anger
I talk to you and its nothin. ####<meld>neutral
You look at me, and nothin. ####<meld>neutral
Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up here, tomorrow. ####<meld>joy
Well, that was ah... ####<meld>neutral
What?! What are you doing?! ####<meld>surprise
Do you know what just happened? ####<meld>anger
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep. ####<meld>neutral
No. We were in the middle of sexand ####<meld>neutral
Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world! ####<meld>joy
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. ####<meld>neutral
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, why is your bag moving? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, it's not! ####<meld>neutral
Seriously, it's moving! ####<meld>surprise
What the hell is in there? ####<meld>surprise
It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. ####<meld>neutral
There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. ####<meld>neutral
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. ####<meld>neutral
And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. ####<meld>anger
And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Rach? ####<meld>surprise
Ill be out in a second. ####<meld>neutral
Oh.  Its just so unexpected! II uhBoy Ill tell you its just such an honor to be nominated for a ####<meld>joy

Please, dont play the music. Just uh one more. ####<meld>joy
I can't believe you don't want to know. ####<meld>surprise
I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... ####<meld>joy
And Monica knows... ####<meld>neutral
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know! ####<meld>surprise
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me. ####<meld>neutral
So what's it gonna be? ####<meld>joy
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know! ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt! ####<meld>joy
Or an uncle... ####<meld>neutral
Hey Phoebe! ####<meld>joy
Hi Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe, what's the matter? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, right, that's me! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. ####<meld>neutral
Fine. ####<meld>neutral

More coffee over here, please! ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. What, what are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise

Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas.... ####<meld>neutral
Destiny. ####<meld>neutral
Sure. ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesnt look very fulfilled. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back. ####<meld>neutral
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist. ####<meld>anger
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones. ####<meld>neutral
So, what happens to the old guys? ####<meld>sadness
Well, they go into the chipper. ####<meld>neutral
Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!! ####<meld>fear
Hey! Hey!! ####<meld>surprise
Light still out? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Maybe they're- napping. ####<meld>neutral
Oh please, they're having sex. ####<meld>sadness
Shut up! ####<meld>anger
So, whaddya think George is like? ####<meld>neutral
I think he's shy. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean, ####<meld>joy
Arent you with that girl over there? ####<meld>neutral
Well, yeah, kinda. ####<meld>neutral
Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you. ####<meld>neutral
No, no, no, its flattery. ####<meld>joy
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. ####<meld>joy
Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast. ####<meld>fear
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity... ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, for you. Is that the list? ####<meld>neutral
Um, yeah. ####<meld>neutral
May I see it? ####<meld>neutral
Um, no. ####<meld>fear
Come on! ####<meld>joy
But, okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im not on the list! ####<meld>surprise
Um, see, but thats not the final draft. ####<meld>neutral
Its laminated! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know its ironic... ####<meld>neutral
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. ####<meld>neutral
Were just gonna be friends. ####<meld>neutral
Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get! ####<meld>anger
Hey Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Ohh! You made up! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, get a room. ####<meld>disgust
We have one. ####<meld>neutral
I know. Use it. ####<meld>disgust
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot! ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani! ####<meld>surprise
Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break! ####<meld>anger
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me! ####<meld>anger
So thats the only reason she could be here huh? ####<meld>neutral
It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me! ####<meld>anger
I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later. ####<meld>neutral
Good-bye. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa! ####<meld>surprise
Uh, that was your sister actually. ####<meld>neutral
She-she thinks that youre just using me. ####<meld>neutral
So? ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
What are you doing here?! ####<meld>surprise
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Umm, okay, okay, look. ####<meld>neutral
I took this picture from your fridge. ####<meld>anger
Okay, because I know that this is my Father. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. ####<meld>anger
Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. ####<meld>anger
All right? ####<meld>anger
So if you can help me find my Father then you should! ####<meld>anger
Otherwise, youre just mean! ####<meld>anger
So, just tell me the truth! ####<meld>anger
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni. ####<meld>neutral
My Father is Chuck Magioni? ####<meld>surprise
No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! ####<meld>neutral
And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth. ####<meld>sadness
Oh. ####<meld>sadness
But umm, youre right. ####<meld>neutral
I think that a person should know where they come from. ####<meld>neutral
Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im your mother. ####<meld>neutral
Heh? ####<meld>surprise
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and... ####<meld>sadness
Whats happening to your accent? ####<meld>surprise
Come again? ####<meld>surprise
Whats-whats this nonsense? ####<meld>fear
All right, Im-Im not English. ####<meld>sadness
Im from Long Island. ####<meld>neutral
I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
So, if we could just get back to the lecture. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, were there any questions? ####<meld>neutral
About paleontology. ####<meld>neutral
All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. ####<meld>anger
Obviously, I screwed up. ####<meld>sadness
But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here. ####<meld>neutral
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression ####<meld>neutral
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am ####<meld>anger
Well, hello Rachel! ####<meld>surprise
Where you going, Joe? ####<meld>neutral
For a walk. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. You mind if I join you? ####<meld>neutral
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts. ####<meld>neutral
Your thoughts? Plural? ####<meld>surprise
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her! ####<meld>joy
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? ####<meld>anger
You guys are killing me! ####<meld>sadness
She's forbidden fruit! ####<meld>sadness
It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? ####<meld>sadness
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go. ####<meld>neutral
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of. ####<meld>anger
Great novels? ####<meld>surprise
Fine ... mediocre porn ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office. ####<meld>neutral
Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk. ####<meld>neutral
Thats kinda sad. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her, ####<meld>neutral
Got it! ####<meld>joy
Lets roll! ####<meld>joy
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan. ####<meld>neutral
Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? ####<meld>neutral
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! No problem! I ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
You are iron. ####<meld>neutral
You are steel! ####<meld>joy
Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half? ####<meld>anger
I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training? ####<meld>neutral
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?! ####<meld>surprise
Look, you and I went to different high schools... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school. ####<meld>neutral
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. ####<meld>neutral
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made. ####<meld>sadness
They had to have that specially made?! ####<meld>surprise
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot! ####<meld>surprise
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. ####<meld>surprise
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. ####<meld>joy
I-I owe her this. ####<meld>neutral
I never let her eat. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you go out with him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy? ####<meld>neutral
Ill try. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, okay. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.. ####<meld>joy
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow! ####<meld>anger
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know ####<meld>neutral
Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you. ####<meld>anger
Yeah but ####<meld>sadness
Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind. ####<meld>neutral
Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin! ####<meld>anger
Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie! ####<meld>joy
Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets! ####<meld>joy
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? ####<meld>joy
Sure! ####<meld>joy
He got it a flea market! ####<meld>joy
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little. ####<meld>disgust
And Joey? ####<meld>neutral
How do you think she's doing? ####<meld>neutral
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross? ####<meld>surprise
Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I .... ####<meld>surprise
Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Now that Rachel's gone? ####<meld>neutral
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, god help us. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww! ####<meld>disgust
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me. ####<meld>disgust
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please? ####<meld>sadness
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there. ####<meld>joy
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms. ####<meld>joy
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little. ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean? ####<meld>surprise
Carol our sex life isits just not working ####<meld>sadness
Hey there little fella! ####<meld>joy
Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on ya, huh? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! ####<meld>joy
Yay! ####<meld>joy
Yay! ####<meld>joy
Yay! ####<meld>joy
Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things. ####<meld>neutral
For fun? ####<meld>neutral
Like what? ####<meld>surprise
Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up? ####<meld>joy
Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. ####<meld>neutral
Nah! ####<meld>disgust
Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, we could, we could have a threesome. ####<meld>neutral
I love that idea! ####<meld>joy
So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box. ####<meld>anger
Oh my God, they took my idea! ####<meld>surprise
That was you?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Okay, here you go. ####<meld>joy
Rachel, I made you a cocoa. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, are you guys okay? ####<meld>surprise
Are you all right? ####<meld>surprise
Oh my. ####<meld>surprise
Sit! ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my gosh, Joshua! ####<meld>surprise
All those things I said about not being ready ####<meld>neutral
Theyre not true? ####<meld>fear
No, theyre-theyre all true. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>joy
But ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Oh, I love that but. ####<meld>surprise
You wanna go inside and have some coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Every time. ####<meld>neutral
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps! ####<meld>anger
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. ####<meld>sadness
Why would we do that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry! ####<meld>joy
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away. ####<meld>surprise
The balloon? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached ####<meld>neutral
I can't, I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen? ####<meld>surprise
Almost never. ####<meld>anger
Got the keys? ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
What d'you think? ####<meld>neutral
Lot of things. ####<meld>neutral
Which one do you think she is? ####<meld>neutral
May I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. ####<meld>neutral
You don't observe a dance class. You ####<meld>neutral
What does she mean? ####<meld>neutral
I think she means  'You ####<meld>neutral
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? ####<meld>anger
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again! ####<meld>anger
She could be you. ####<meld>neutral
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I'm not getting this! ####<meld>anger
I'm totally getting it! ####<meld>joy
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? ####<meld>sadness
What? You just click when they click. ####<meld>surprise
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Great. It's gym class all over again. ####<meld>disgust
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that. ####<meld>surprise
Nooo, it wasn't. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... ####<meld>joy
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day. ####<meld>joy
I know ####<meld>neutral
Open your drapes! Open your drapes! ####<meld>joy
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms! ####<meld>joy
The sun is out! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Remember when I had corneas? ####<meld>anger
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion. ####<meld>neutral
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Walls are pretty thin, guys! ####<meld>anger
Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids. ####<meld>joy
Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in? ####<meld>sadness
Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks.  Well but this one starts now. ####<meld>neutral
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. Its a twins study. ####<meld>neutral
But its $2,000. ####<meld>surprise
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists. ####<meld>neutral
We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good. ####<meld>joy
Hey! Hows it goin? ####<meld>neutral
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Yes it has! I made cookies! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato chips. ####<meld>neutral
But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ill be out in a second. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
That doesnt lock does it? ####<meld>neutral
You know, it still smells like monkey in there. ####<meld>disgust
That saves us a conversation. ####<meld>neutral
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped. ####<meld>neutral
Me too, we should get goin'. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, here comes another camera. ####<meld>neutral
Right. No biggie. Stay loose. ####<meld>neutral
Why do they keep doing that? ####<meld>neutral
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. ####<meld>neutral
Theyve been taping those people up there all day. ####<meld>neutral
Right. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there? ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants? ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Youre a good dancer! ####<meld>surprise
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little. ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean? ####<meld>neutral
Like this. ####<meld>neutral
Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no-no we came together! ####<meld>joy
I dont see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! ####<meld>neutral
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot. ####<meld>sadness
Really, ythink so? I dont.. ####<meld>anger
Why arent you home yet?! ####<meld>anger
Is someone there? ####<meld>anger
Oh yes, its me! Sorry! ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing here? ####<meld>neutral

Oh my God, look-look hes taking off her clothes! ####<meld>sadness
Hes taking off her coat! ####<meld>disgust
Oh, this is just terrible. ####<meld>disgust

Okay, break-ups still on! ####<meld>anger
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it. ####<meld>sadness
No, I dont want to hit you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh what then? Kick me? ####<meld>anger
No. ####<meld>neutral
My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh, what are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out. ####<meld>fear
Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend ####<meld>joy
Sure! ####<meld>joy
Horny bitch.  No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre the horny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch! ####<meld>anger
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men! ####<meld>joy
Well, like father, like son. ####<meld>neutral
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious. ####<meld>joy
Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling. ####<meld>surprise
Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right? ####<meld>fear
Ummmmmmmm, no. ####<meld>neutral
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that! ####<meld>anger
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea. ####<meld>sadness
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Had that dream. ####<meld>neutral
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there. ####<meld>surprise
Instead of...? ####<meld>surprise
That's right. ####<meld>neutral
Never had that dream. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. ####<meld>neutral
Honey! Dinners ready! ####<meld>joy
Whats my little chef got for me tonight? ####<meld>joy
Your favorite! ####<meld>joy
Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese! ####<meld>joy
Yep! And lots of it! ####<meld>joy
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay. ####<meld>joy
Okay, in we go. ####<meld>joy
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin? ####<meld>joy
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. ####<meld>neutral
So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. ####<meld>joy
Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia. ####<meld>anger
Come on, they're close. ####<meld>neutral
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it? ####<meld>disgust
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean... ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god, what were you thinking? ####<meld>disgust
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Ow! ####<meld>surprise
I'm outta here. ####<meld>disgust
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up. ####<meld>neutral
Hello! One marriage please! ####<meld>joy
Yep, we wanna get married! ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum! ####<meld>joy
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that's ####<meld>neutral
No, only because that's the graduation song. ####<meld>neutral
Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married! ####<meld>joy
Are you sure you wanna do this? ####<meld>neutral
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! ####<meld>joy
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! ####<meld>joy
Wait!  Okay! ####<meld>neutral
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone? ####<meld>neutral
It depends on who asked. ####<meld>neutral
What if I asked? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Mon, sure. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yes.  Youre not asking are you? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Totally! ####<meld>joy
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened? ####<meld>joy
He asked you out?! ####<meld>surprise
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse. ####<meld>joy
Saucy! ####<meld>joy
What are these? ####<meld>neutral
Electrical plans for the building. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared? ####<meld>fear
I know that switch does something, okay? ####<meld>neutral
So-so I went down to city hall and got these. ####<meld>neutral
All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours. ####<meld>sadness
Wow! If only more people knew. ####<meld>surprise
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking. ####<meld>neutral
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, nobody's judging you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! ####<meld>joy
Oh man! ####<meld>surprise
I want that place so much!! ####<meld>joy
I was so sure that was gonna work! ####<meld>sadness
There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! ####<meld>disgust
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie. ####<meld>neutral
Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Bye Chandler!   I miss you already. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!! ####<meld>disgust
Actually, I did! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me? ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us! ####<meld>surprise
Are you serious? ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it! ####<meld>anger
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows! ####<meld>anger
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out. ####<meld>fear
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off. ####<meld>neutral
No, let's just leave the lights on. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go? ####<meld>anger
Oh fine. ####<meld>neutral
Ready?  Wrestle! ####<meld>joy
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area. ####<meld>neutral
Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance! ####<meld>fear
Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick. ####<meld>anger
All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke. ####<meld>neutral
Steady. ####<meld>neutral
Steady. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, a little higher. ####<meld>neutral
Careful of the angle. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay, were approaching the window  Thread the needle. ####<meld>neutral
Thread the needle. ####<meld>neutral
Hes alive! Hes a-live!!! ####<meld>joy
And yet, were still poking him. ####<meld>disgust
Okay, retract the device, retract the device. ####<meld>neutral
He does not look happy. ####<meld>anger
Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! ####<meld>anger
Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. ####<meld>sadness
Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. ####<meld>disgust
Oh God oh! ####<meld>surprise
Contraction! ####<meld>surprise
Are you looking at her?! ####<meld>anger
No! ####<meld>anger
Dont you look at her you sick bastard! ####<meld>anger
Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her! ####<meld>fear
Shes in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch! ####<meld>anger
Umm. Umm, Im-Im just gonna ####<meld>neutral
See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert! ####<meld>anger
No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. ####<meld>neutral
You miss your girlfriend? ####<meld>neutral
Just ignore them. ####<meld>neutral
Ross. ####<meld>neutral
What? What? ####<meld>fear
Hes looking at me. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?! ####<meld>anger

Alex Trebek? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, of course! ####<meld>joy
Chuck Woolery? ####<meld>neutral
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, whos ass I cannot kick. ####<meld>joy
Say it! ####<meld>joy
Say we are unagi! ####<meld>joy
Its not something you are! Its something you have! ####<meld>anger
Say it! ####<meld>joy
Yknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt! ####<meld>anger
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it's in there. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Ohh! Oh!! ####<meld>surprise
Joey, can I talk to you for a second? ####<meld>neutral
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!! ####<meld>surprise
oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh ####<meld>surprise
Yes. Yes. ####<meld>neutral
You?!  And-and you?! ####<meld>surprise
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows! ####<meld>joy
How?! When?! ####<meld>surprise
It happened in London. ####<meld>neutral
IN LONDON!!! ####<meld>surprise
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. ####<meld>neutral
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! ####<meld>surprise
No-no-no-no-no! You can't! ####<meld>fear
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell. ####<meld>fear
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's ####<meld>surprise
I know, it's great! ####<meld>joy
Aww, I don't want to see that! ####<meld>disgust
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey! ####<meld>sadness
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb. ####<meld>neutral
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb? ####<meld>neutral
No Cobb, as in cobb salad. ####<meld>neutral
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad? ####<meld>neutral
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do? ####<meld>fear
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby? ####<meld>surprise
You got a better idea? ####<meld>neutral
All right, call it in the air. ####<meld>neutral
Heads. ####<meld>neutral
Heads it is. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Whew! ####<meld>joy
We have to assign heads to something. ####<meld>neutral
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads. ####<meld>neutral
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday? ####<meld>anger
Okay, some tricks of the trade. ####<meld>neutral
Now, Ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. ####<meld>neutral
Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that Ive just done something evil. ####<meld>neutral
That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it  Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. ####<meld>neutral
And thats how its done. ####<meld>neutral
Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed. ####<meld>joy
Hey, Mr. Trib. ####<meld>neutral
Hey-hey. ####<meld>joy
Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down. ####<meld>neutral
Who are you? ####<meld>surprise
Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate. ####<meld>neutral
Im Chandlers new roommate. ####<meld>surprise
I-I-I dont think so. ####<meld>surprise
I could be Chandlers new roommate. ####<meld>surprise
But, he told me over the phone. ####<meld>surprise
He told me in person. ####<meld>neutral
Thats weird. ####<meld>surprise
Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Look who I found! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, hey guys! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter. ####<meld>neutral
Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? ####<meld>neutral
Didnt think so! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are! ####<meld>neutral
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage? ####<meld>anger
Hmm, how about my azzz? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, this is hollow. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!! ####<meld>surprise
No, dont look directly at them! ####<meld>fear
What? ####<meld>surprise
Alright, no, we could look at them! ####<meld>neutral
I ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. I-I wished youd called first. ####<meld>joy
Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good. ####<meld>joy
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, whats up? ####<meld>neutral
I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it. ####<meld>neutral
Ma, youre asking me to marry you? ####<meld>surprise
This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel. ####<meld>joy
Mom no, come on! Thank you. ####<meld>surprise
Just hear me out! ####<meld>fear
Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. ####<meld>sadness
I cant believe this! ####<meld>sadness
I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross. ####<meld>sadness
Youre, youre really, youre so good. ####<meld>sadness
Thanks. ####<meld>sadness
And youre so sweet.  And youre kind ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>sadness
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, its okay. ####<meld>neutral
Wait, wait, wait. ####<meld>joy
My foot is stuck in the pocket. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
No, I cant get it out. ####<meld>sadness
Rachel? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah.  Hi Mark! ####<meld>surprise
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I did! ####<meld>surprise

Oh my God!! ####<meld>surprise
Congratulations...oh..wow ####<meld>joy
I cant believe I did this! What an idiot! ####<meld>anger
Oh, stop beating yourself up! ####<meld>sadness
People make mistakes! ####<meld>neutral
These things happen! ####<meld>neutral
There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there? ####<meld>neutral
Apparently youre not very good at it! ####<meld>anger
I ####<meld>neutral
Philadelphia. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps. ####<meld>surprise
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>joy
But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot! ####<meld>sadness
Did you hear that?! ####<meld>neutral
I dont need you guys to care about me! ####<meld>anger
Because the universe cares! ####<meld>joy
The whole universe! ####<meld>joy
I really wished theyd care just a little bit though. ####<meld>sadness
I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and thats why I have to kill you." ####<meld>joy
They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me? ####<meld>surprise
Do you really want to pull at that thread? ####<meld>surprise
Im having a really good time! ####<meld>joy
Me too! Im sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck. ####<meld>sadness
Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend. ####<meld>neutral
Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go? ####<meld>fear
Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost. ####<meld>sadness
I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss andOh no! No! No! My God! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, dont freak out. Ill go. ####<meld>neutral
No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, umm thats Whitney , Kyles ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out? ####<meld>neutral
What?! No! ####<meld>surprise
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I dont think so Pheebs.  All right, Ill do it. But just because youre a friend. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings? ####<meld>neutral
I'll take sports. ####<meld>neutral
Mine! ####<meld>neutral
All right. Uhh, international. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say ####<meld>neutral
You two will have very hairy children. ####<meld>disgust
Okay, I didn't know you would say that. ####<meld>surprise
Ross! Janice?! ####<meld>anger
All right, hold on! ####<meld>neutral
Hold on. ####<meld>neutral
Hold on. ####<meld>neutral
This is Ross, okay? ####<meld>neutral
He's our friend. ####<meld>neutral
He obviously went crazy. ####<meld>anger
He obviously lost his mind. ####<meld>anger
So are you actually gonna see her again? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head! ####<meld>anger
Damnit Phoebe!! ####<meld>anger
Hey, dont we have to... ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we got, um-hmm. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, I think youre really, really great... ####<meld>joy
Oh God! ####<meld>sadness
Here we go again. ####<meld>sadness
Why does this keep happening to me? ####<meld>anger
Is it something Im putting out there? ####<meld>sadness
Is this my fault? ####<meld>sadness
Or am I just nuts? ####<meld>sadness
I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say. ####<meld>surprise
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house. ####<meld>disgust
Wait! ####<meld>sadness
Terry! ####<meld>sadness
Please! ####<meld>sadness
Look, I just lost my other job. ####<meld>sadness
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
You have no idea how much I need this. ####<meld>sadness
Please, help me out, for old times sake. ####<meld>sadness
This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its hopeless. ####<meld>sadness
Its not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramorays a miracle worker. Look, here he comes. ####<meld>joy
Good morning.  Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me? ####<meld>neutral
Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha! ####<meld>joy
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane. ####<meld>anger
Well you did pull his hair. ####<meld>neutral
He took my snack! ####<meld>anger
Im not getting into this again! ####<meld>anger
Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad. ####<meld>sadness
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay. ####<meld>anger
This doesnt mean anything, does it? ####<meld>fear
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right? ####<meld>anger
That is true. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, you know you dont actually have one. ####<meld>neutral
Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her! ####<meld>sadness
Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me. ####<meld>anger
All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room. ####<meld>neutral
What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting! ####<meld>anger
The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while! ####<meld>neutral
But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me! ####<meld>anger
Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital. ####<meld>fear
But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years. ####<meld>neutral
I think thats gum. ####<meld>neutral
Im pretty sure its gun. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go. ####<meld>anger
A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do? ####<meld>anger
That was the only way I could get him to ####<meld>neutral
Hi! How are the Gellers? ####<meld>neutral
Dont call us that! ####<meld>anger
The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? ####<meld>anger
Hey! Its Porsche!! ####<meld>anger
Hey sweetie! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Theres no back to this couch! ####<meld>surprise
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you. ####<meld>joy
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest. ####<meld>neutral
Stop it! ####<meld>joy
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this. ####<meld>neutral
I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Of course he is! ####<meld>joy
What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse? ####<meld>joy
What kind of father do you think I am? ####<meld>anger
All right, sorry. ####<meld>neutral
I gotta go make a fake Ben. ####<meld>neutral
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy! ####<meld>surprise
Well, either that or uh ####<meld>neutral
Joey!! ####<meld>anger
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?! ####<meld>anger
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it! ####<meld>joy
They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!! ####<meld>joy
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!! ####<meld>joy
Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a ####<meld>anger

He is so cute! ####<meld>joy
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop thewowww. ####<meld>joy
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, isn't he? ####<meld>joy
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight. ####<meld>joy
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed. ####<meld>joy
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity. ####<meld>surprise
Huh. That's nice. ####<meld>neutral
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for ####<meld>neutral
Eight whole days. ####<meld>neutral
Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end. ####<meld>joy
Awesome! ####<meld>joy
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
My favorite part was when ####<meld>neutral
The Armadillo was actually not so ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunnys funeral in here. ####<meld>surprise
Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles! ####<meld>joy
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I understand why ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, sure. Good luck! ####<meld>joy
Im quitting!! Woo-hoo!  Im okay!! Im all right!! ####<meld>joy
Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No? ####<meld>surprise
Why would you say that? ####<meld>neutral
Cause youre still into Monica. ####<meld>neutral
So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and... ####<meld>neutral
Youre good. Youre good! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though? ####<meld>fear
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what? ####<meld>neutral
Thanks a lot. ####<meld>neutral
No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi. ####<meld>neutral
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! ####<meld>anger
Oh, hey, hey, I got that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thanks, sweetie. ####<meld>joy
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me? ####<meld>fear
No, no, they will. I just... uh... ####<meld>neutral
Can't wait. ####<meld>neutral
Do I know you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been? ####<meld>surprise
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now. ####<meld>neutral
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight. ####<meld>surprise
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage. ####<meld>joy
Uh, wait, backstage? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band. ####<meld>neutral
Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Look, you guys wanna meet the group? ####<meld>neutral
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad? ####<meld>surprise
Do you have any respect for your body? ####<meld>disgust
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? ####<meld>disgust
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. ####<meld>anger
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
He does? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, buddy, what's up! ####<meld>joy
Oh, she told you about that, huh. ####<meld>surprise
Well, yeah, I have one now and then. ####<meld>neutral
Well, yeah, now. ####<meld>neutral
Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. ####<meld>neutral
Well, okay, thanks! ####<meld>joy
God, he's good. ####<meld>joy
If only he were a woman. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, look look look. ####<meld>surprise
The last candle's about to burn out. ####<meld>neutral
10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Kinda... spooky without any lights. ####<meld>fear
Bwah-hah-hah! ####<meld>joy
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah... ####<meld>joy
Oh.. oh... oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica. ####<meld>neutral
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life? ####<meld>neutral
You blew them away! ####<meld>joy
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! ####<meld>joy
I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me? ####<meld>neutral
I was ####<meld>surprise
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God!  I'm your ####<meld>surprise
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room! ####<meld>joy
Look, I took it too far! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Monica: Right foot red. ####<meld>neutral
Could've played ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good. ####<meld>neutral
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the ####<meld>neutral
Oh, okay. Will you take my place? ####<meld>neutral
Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Nooo! ####<meld>surprise
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. ####<meld>joy
Green. To the green. ####<meld>neutral
I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind. ####<meld>neutral
To the left, to the left- aww! ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh... I'm fine. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Please tell me you got the message! ####<meld>fear
What message? ####<meld>neutral
The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Its 6 oclock! ####<meld>surprise
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! ####<meld>fear
I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! ####<meld>anger
I went to Rosss! ####<meld>neutral
I went to the coffeehouse! ####<meld>neutral
I went to any place that they made sandwiches! ####<meld>neutral
Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what you think. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe? ####<meld>neutral
Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse. ####<meld>neutral
What was her name? ####<meld>neutral
Nestley Toulouse. ####<meld>neutral
Nestlé Toll House? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language. ####<meld>neutral
Yes!!  Oh. ####<meld>surprise
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time! ####<meld>anger
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!! ####<meld>anger
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink? ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely! ####<meld>joy
I am so on board! ####<meld>joy
Rachel didn't you just light that? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach. ####<meld>neutral
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately. ####<meld>neutral
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like ####<meld>disgust
Tell me about it! ####<meld>neutral
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit! ####<meld>joy
It does sound appealing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I never could do it. ####<meld>joy
Oh but you could. ####<meld>neutral
You can. ####<meld>neutral
Absolutely! ####<meld>joy
We can help each other out! ####<meld>joy
We can get--what are those--those patches! ####<meld>neutral
We could be like the Patch Sisters! ####<meld>joy
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit! ####<meld>joy
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! ####<meld>joy
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding. ####<meld>sadness
Okay then! ####<meld>joy
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? ####<meld>neutral
Does, um, anyone wanna see? ####<meld>neutral
Nooo.. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! ####<meld>anger
It's worse than the thumb! ####<meld>disgust
Hey, this is so unfair! ####<meld>anger
Oh, why is it unfair? ####<meld>surprise
So I have a flaw! ####<meld>anger
Big deal! ####<meld>anger
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? ####<meld>anger
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? ####<meld>anger
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? ####<meld>anger
I mean, what the hell is that thing? ####<meld>disgust
...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? ####<meld>anger
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? ####<meld>anger
Well, I-I could live without it. ####<meld>neutral
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh,  "you do, do you"? ####<meld>anger
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. ####<meld>neutral
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. ####<meld>anger
Awww! Mel Torme died. ####<meld>sadness
Joey, that papers like a year old! ####<meld>neutral
Aw! Does that mean the ####<meld>sadness
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
You're sure? You're absolutely sure? ####<meld>neutral
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does. ####<meld>neutral
Probably? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I don't like that word. ####<meld>disgust
Kind of what probably really means. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" ####<meld>anger
You gotta take care of yourselves! ####<meld>neutral
In ####<meld>neutral
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? ####<meld>neutral
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride. ####<meld>joy
Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he? ####<meld>joy
Hes a keeper. How are you feeling? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Im fine. ####<meld>neutral
Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married? ####<meld>neutral
Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross! ####<meld>neutral
Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family. ####<meld>neutral
Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross. ####<meld>sadness
Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs. ####<meld>disgust
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. Whos that? ####<meld>neutral
New people. ####<meld>neutral
What happened to the Disgustingtons? ####<meld>neutral
Theyre having their baby! ####<meld>anger
Its not fair Ross we got here first! ####<meld>anger
Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. ####<meld>neutral
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people? ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Look at that guy by the window, wow! ####<meld>surprise
Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, what is wrong with me lately? ####<meld>sadness
I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here. ####<meld>neutral
Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack. ####<meld>neutral
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! So this has happened to you? ####<meld>surprise
Oh absolutely yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a ####<meld>neutral
Ugh! ####<meld>disgust
I dont know what Im going to do! ####<meld>fear
I called the company that sent and th-they dont care! ####<meld>anger
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is? ####<meld>anger
Hey guys! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey ####<meld>neutral
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! ####<meld>joy
And the guys from work had a blast. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so ####<meld>surprise
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, right! ####<meld>joy
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those ####<meld>neutral
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her. ####<meld>surprise
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? ####<meld>surprise
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life. ####<meld>joy
So you might say, its a magic ring. ####<meld>joy
OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!! ####<meld>surprise
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her. ####<meld>neutral
Obviously! So, how do we decide? ####<meld>neutral
Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her ####<meld>joy
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah well we should order some food then. ####<meld>neutral
No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well ####<meld>neutral
That sounds fair. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street ####<meld>neutral
Ah yeahwait a second now! ####<meld>anger
Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. ####<meld>neutral
I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that. ####<meld>anger
Well sorry, thats what I do on dates. ####<meld>neutral
All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates. ####<meld>neutral
So lets decide on the spending limit ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars? ####<meld>neutral
I was thinking more like a hundred. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars? ####<meld>neutral
Hi, again. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Thank you soo, much. ####<meld>joy
Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work. ####<meld>anger
You want some help with that? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont! ####<meld>neutral
Whoa! Are you okay? ####<meld>surprise
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush. ####<meld>surprise
Its the heat.  And-and the humidity. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a uh, thats a tough combination. ####<meld>neutral
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade? ####<meld>neutral
Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place. ####<meld>surprise
What do you mean? ####<meld>neutral
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, somebody left their keys. ####<meld>neutral
Ooohh, to a Porsche! ####<meld>surprise
Hey Gunther, these yours? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years! ####<meld>disgust
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys? ####<meld>neutral
Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found? ####<meld>neutral
Theres a lost and found?  My shoe! ####<meld>surprise
You left a shoe here?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I didnt realize until I got home. ####<meld>neutral
I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! ####<meld>neutral
Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe. ####<meld>neutral
Great! Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep. ####<meld>neutral
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? ####<meld>joy
We have a good time. ####<meld>joy
We laugh, we play. ####<meld>joy
It's like we're father and son. ####<meld>joy
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. ####<meld>joy
Oh, this is so cute. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I got that for him. ####<meld>neutral
My mommies love me. That's clever. ####<meld>joy
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew! ####<meld>neutral
Uh huh? ####<meld>neutral
Uh huh? ####<meld>neutral
Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great. ####<meld>neutral
See ya then. ####<meld>neutral
Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Did you just say Hi, Jew? ####<meld>surprise
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. ####<meld>neutral
Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes! ####<meld>joy
Thanks Monica! ####<meld>joy
Does that smell bother you? ####<meld>disgust
What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here. ####<meld>surprise
Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it. ####<meld>neutral
I can smell it a little, bake the pie. ####<meld>joy
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector. ####<meld>neutral
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, it was the candles. ####<meld>neutral
Its very not good leaving candles unattended. ####<meld>neutral
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I have to go now. ####<meld>neutral
Joey proposed to me. ####<meld>surprise
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I-I said yes. ####<meld>fear
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Are you crazy? ####<meld>anger
You just had Ross’s baby! ####<meld>anger
It’s-it’s so  inappropriate. ####<meld>anger
No, it’s worse than that. ####<meld>disgust
It’s wrong. ####<meld>disgust
It’s… It is bigger than  mine! ####<meld>surprise
I know. ####<meld>neutral
You can’t marry him! ####<meld>sadness
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much. ####<meld>sadness
Well do you love him? ####<meld>neutral
Sure. ####<meld>neutral
Sure? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I mean whatever. ####<meld>neutral
Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey? ####<meld>sadness
No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him? ####<meld>sadness
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart? ####<meld>neutral
Here comes the bride. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God Monica! ####<meld>surprise
I wanna wear this everyday. ####<meld>joy
You look so beautiful. ####<meld>joy
Im so happy for me. ####<meld>joy
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet? ####<meld>fear
Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine. ####<meld>neutral
Damnit! ####<meld>anger
I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay? ####<meld>anger
Fine. ####<meld>neutral
Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. ####<meld>anger
And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want! ####<meld>anger
No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I ####<meld>neutral
Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff! ####<meld>sadness
And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway! ####<meld>neutral
Crap!! ####<meld>anger
I gotta go! ####<meld>neutral
Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Me neither! We have to get in! ####<meld>surprise
Just act like you belong. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Oranges! ####<meld>surprise
Shh!  Nice to see you again. ####<meld>neutral
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, of course. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. ####<meld>joy
All I really needed was a plan. ####<meld>neutral
See I wanna have three kids ####<meld>neutral
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother. ####<meld>joy
As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years. ####<meld>neutral
You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed! ####<meld>joy
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically, ####<meld>anger
Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? ####<meld>anger
I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Why am I not surprised? ####<meld>disgust
Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this! ####<meld>anger
I dont think you have much choice. ####<meld>neutral
Well well see! ####<meld>anger
Bye-bye! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer? ####<meld>neutral
Yes. Yes. Just here  and there . ####<meld>neutral
Dad? ####<meld>neutral
Im here! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work. ####<meld>joy
Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house. ####<meld>sadness
Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling. ####<meld>neutral
Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories ####<meld>joy
Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven ####<meld>neutral
I used to ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a ####<meld>neutral
Ok, got the vent open. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue! ####<meld>joy
Ben, you ready? ####<meld>neutral
All right, gimme your foot. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, on three, Ben. ####<meld>neutral
One, two, three. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, That's it, Ben. ####<meld>neutral
What do you see? ####<meld>neutral
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebs, It's open! It's open! ####<meld>surprise
Wait! You forgot your legs! ####<meld>surprise
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system. ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Filing system? ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh! ####<meld>surprise
You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? ####<meld>neutral
It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets. ####<meld>joy
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that. ####<meld>neutral
I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me. ####<meld>joy
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost ####<meld>joy
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once! ####<meld>joy
Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I realize that ####<meld>neutral
And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean. ####<meld>neutral
I love working with designers! ####<meld>joy
With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach? ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, you have an assistant right? ####<meld>neutral
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick! ####<meld>fear
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile. ####<meld>neutral
I do? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Or not. ####<meld>neutral
Where's Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Here I am. ####<meld>neutral
Wash your hands!!! ####<meld>disgust
How did youknow? ####<meld>surprise
Hey! What's she doing back here? ####<meld>surprise
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! ####<meld>neutral
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... ####<meld>neutral
What happened in Atlantic City?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar ####<meld>neutral
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!" ####<meld>anger
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? ####<meld>neutral
So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. ####<meld>neutral
Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls. ####<meld>joy
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. ####<meld>anger
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard ####<meld>joy
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again? ####<meld>anger
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. ####<meld>neutral
So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you? ####<meld>neutral
Of course I am! ####<meld>joy
Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot. ####<meld>neutral
Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. ####<meld>neutral
And-and then guess what? ####<meld>neutral
The babys coming and I dont know what to do. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie? ####<meld>sadness
No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine. ####<meld>neutral
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going? ####<meld>fear
Im going to the bathroom. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
It ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty? ####<meld>surprise
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower. ####<meld>neutral
Not if you were here. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you! ####<meld>joy
I hope its you. ####<meld>neutral
Me too! ####<meld>joy
First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me ####<meld>joy
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?! ####<meld>joy
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other. ####<meld>neutral
Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine ####<meld>neutral
Yes!!! Oh!! ####<meld>joy
Hypothetically! ####<meld>anger
Still. ####<meld>neutral
If Phoebe were my maid of honor ####<meld>neutral
Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours? ####<meld>neutral
Well thats the best part. Umm, ####<meld>neutral
Wh-why is that the best part? ####<meld>surprise
Because then I dont have to! ####<meld>joy
Well of ####<meld>neutral
Im really not deciding! ####<meld>joy
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady! ####<meld>joy
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway? ####<meld>neutral
It's not just the drum noise. ####<meld>neutral
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! ####<meld>anger
Oh god, my eye!" ####<meld>anger
I mean, it is so annoying. ####<meld>anger
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore? ####<meld>surprise
Maybe on some level. ####<meld>neutral
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room? ####<meld>surprise
No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you. ####<meld>joy
And, a brownie! ####<meld>joy
Well, half a brownie. ####<meld>neutral
Actually, its just bag. ####<meld>neutral
Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so ####<meld>neutral
Oh man! ####<meld>joy
This is so great! ####<meld>joy
I actually feel like Im going on a real date! ####<meld>joy
Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere. ####<meld>neutral
Hey come on now, this is a real date. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, sonice place you got here. ####<meld>neutral
Foosball, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Pizza box. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, a subscription to ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, actually thats my roommates. ####<meld>neutral
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy. ####<meld>neutral
Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself. ####<meld>neutral
Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking? ####<meld>joy
Hm-mmm ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on! ####<meld>anger
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being? ####<meld>anger
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive. ####<meld>neutral
Ha. Ha, ha. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black. ####<meld>neutral
Please! I am not as bad as Ross. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, I beg to differ. The ####<meld>neutral
That was ####<meld>neutral
Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview! ####<meld>joy
Well, not playing raquetball! ####<meld>surprise
He forgot to leave his grip size! ####<meld>surprise
He didn't get the goggles! ####<meld>surprise
Well,sounds like you two have issues. ####<meld>neutral
Goodbye, baby. ####<meld>neutral
Ciao, bela. ####<meld>neutral
Do they wait for me to do this? ####<meld>neutral
So are you gonna tell him? ####<meld>neutral
Why would I tell him? ####<meld>neutral
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might. ####<meld>neutral
What are you guys doing here? ####<meld>anger
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap! ####<meld>surprise
...What did I ask? ####<meld>neutral
God. I feel violated. ####<meld>disgust
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do? ####<meld>disgust
Ross, ten o'clock. ####<meld>neutral
Is it? Feels like two. ####<meld>sadness
No, ####<meld>neutral
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! ####<meld>joy
Oh. Hel-lo! ####<meld>joy
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men! ####<meld>joy
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone. ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.' ####<meld>fear
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it! ####<meld>joy
Oh please, could she ####<meld>neutral
He could never get a woman like that in a million years. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys. ####<meld>neutral
You could do that! ####<meld>joy
You think? ####<meld>surprise
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down. ####<meld>neutral
OK. ####<meld>neutral
This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment? ####<meld>joy
Thank you Helen, that'll be all. ####<meld>neutral
Last time I do that, I promise. ####<meld>neutral
I am so, so, so, so sorry! ####<meld>sadness
Uh-huh. ####<meld>disgust
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there! ####<meld>fear
Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?! ####<meld>anger
Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please? ####<meld>sadness
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
So, are we going in there? ####<meld>neutral
I am!! ####<meld>joy
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
It actually is in the handbook. ####<meld>neutral
I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office. ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other. ####<meld>sadness
For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more. ####<meld>joy
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong. ####<meld>joy
Stop it! ####<meld>joy
No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo. ####<meld>joy
Shut the book! ####<meld>joy
Lets also get a hot plate! ####<meld>joy
Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends ####<meld>joy
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married? ####<meld>joy
Oh Im not, I just like to try these on. ####<meld>neutral
I do the same thing. ####<meld>neutral
Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25 ####<meld>joy
Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December. ####<meld>joy
So when are you getting married? ####<meld>neutral
Oh May 15 ####<meld>neutral
Oooh its getting close! ####<meld>joy
So uh, whos your photographer? ####<meld>neutral
Jeffrey ####<meld>neutral
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did? ####<meld>neutral
The best man? Wow! ####<meld>surprise
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?! ####<meld>joy
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass. ####<meld>sadness
Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great! ####<meld>joy
Oh yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off. ####<meld>neutral
This place is so overpriced. ####<meld>disgust
So, does this  come in another color or ####<meld>neutral
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. ####<meld>neutral
It was unbelievable! ####<meld>surprise
We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games... ####<meld>joy
So have you called her yet? ####<meld>neutral
Let her know I like her? ####<meld>fear
What are you, insane? ####<meld>anger
It's the next day! ####<meld>joy
How needy do I want to seem? ####<meld>neutral
I'm right, right? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney! ####<meld>anger
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine. ####<meld>neutral
Her answer machine? ####<meld>neutral
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up. ####<meld>neutral
So, uh, why didn't you say anything? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o." ####<meld>disgust
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, okay, what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, they're just talking... ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything? ####<meld>neutral
So, um, what do you do for a living? ####<meld>neutral
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. ####<meld>neutral
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Now that is funny. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? ####<meld>neutral
Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. ####<meld>sadness
I guess. ####<meld>neutral
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine. ####<meld>neutral
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
These people'll scooch down. ####<meld>neutral
You guys'll scooch, won't you? ####<meld>neutral
Let's try scooching! ####<meld>joy
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. ####<meld>neutral
Carol, Kristin. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. ####<meld>neutral
And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
When I was six years old. ####<meld>neutral
Hm-mm ####<meld>neutral
I wanted a big wheel. ####<meld>neutral
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. ####<meld>anger
It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me. ####<meld>sadness
That was a pretty tough year. ####<meld>sadness
Thats-thats great! ####<meld>joy
See? ####<meld>neutral
I already feel like I know you a little better! ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Okay, come on. ####<meld>neutral
Now we can go eat. ####<meld>neutral
Lets go. ####<meld>neutral
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? ####<meld>anger
That's patio furniture! ####<meld>surprise
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course! ####<meld>neutral
What about the birds? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something." ####<meld>neutral
You pick one. ####<meld>neutral
All right, how about the ladybugs? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining! ####<meld>anger
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! ####<meld>anger
Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds! ####<meld>sadness
Bijan for men? ####<meld>neutral
Bijan for men? ####<meld>neutral
Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, actually I sorta have plans. ####<meld>neutral
Ready, Annabelle? ####<meld>neutral
You bet.  Maybe some other time? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?! ####<meld>sadness
That was amazing! ####<meld>joy
Phoebe and Gary are ####<meld>neutral
That was amazing. ####<meld>joy
We are the hottest! Huh? ####<meld>joy
No, you're the best. ####<meld>neutral
No, you're the best. ####<meld>neutral
No, you're the best. ####<meld>neutral
I ####<meld>neutral
Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day? ####<meld>neutral
So what are you gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out. ####<meld>sadness
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while? ####<meld>sadness
Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!! ####<meld>anger
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny. ####<meld>neutral
Why? What happened to him? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing, hes just really believes in that. ####<meld>neutral
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning. ####<meld>joy
Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos. ####<meld>neutral
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?" ####<meld>surprise
Um-hmm, five actually. ####<meld>neutral
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs? ####<meld>neutral
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach. ####<meld>neutral
Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there? ####<meld>neutral
Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. ####<meld>neutral
So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a ####<meld>disgust
No, Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! You guys really dont know anything! ####<meld>surprise
I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school. ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down! ####<meld>disgust
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?! ####<meld>anger
I don't know, clean places? ####<meld>neutral
Mm, yum! ####<meld>neutral
It's Danny. ####<meld>neutral
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala. ####<meld>fear
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later? ####<meld>anger
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?! ####<meld>surprise
The fake kind! ####<meld>anger
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle? ####<meld>neutral
We have a ladle. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks, see you at the party. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, great! ####<meld>joy
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle." ####<meld>neutral
You're so efficient. I love you! ####<meld>joy
Let's go! ####<meld>joy
No-no-no! We need something old! ####<meld>sadness
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve. ####<meld>neutral
That'll work! ####<meld>joy
I don't think so. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, now we just need something borrowed! ####<meld>joy
Here justtake this. ####<meld>neutral
That's stealing! ####<meld>sadness
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh. ####<meld>joy
Okay, one thing at a time. ####<meld>neutral
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, not much. I-I got a job. ####<meld>joy
Oh, that's great. ####<meld>joy
Why are- why are you so tanned? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba. ####<meld>neutral
Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk. ####<meld>joy
Oh God, oh. ####<meld>anger
Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried... ####<meld>sadness
Monica? Monica! ####<meld>anger
Water rules! ####<meld>joy
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work? ####<meld>neutral
Nope. Going to the ####<meld>neutral
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you! ####<meld>anger
No, it is me! ####<meld>joy
Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! ####<meld>anger
Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. ####<meld>joy
I'm- I'm Monana! ####<meld>joy
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people. ####<meld>neutral
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
They've arrested Monica. ####<meld>sadness
Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself. ####<meld>neutral
Now, do you have any idea what you just said? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! ####<meld>neutral
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y. ####<meld>neutral
I just... ####<meld>neutral
I wrote that out phonetically for you. ####<meld>neutral
Phonetically? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly! ####<meld>surprise
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy". ####<meld>joy
Wow. What does ####<meld>surprise
No idea! ####<meld>surprise
But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear". ####<meld>neutral
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance? ####<meld>neutral
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! . ####<meld>neutral
Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't ####<meld>anger
Come on! you... ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Oh.  Oh-oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didnt you come up? ####<meld>surprise
Done! ####<meld>joy
You just finished? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I wanted to be thorough. ####<meld>neutral
I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! ####<meld>joy
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice! ####<meld>joy
So umm, does it? ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Does it? ####<meld>fear
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance. ####<meld>neutral
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! ####<meld>anger
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even ####<meld>anger
No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont ####<meld>neutral
Are you sure? ####<meld>joy
Oh, sure! Im sure. ####<meld>joy
You got married again. ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
So thats your second marriage in two years. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, second in two years. Third overall. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. ####<meld>neutral
Why dont you tell me what happened. ####<meld>neutral
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage? ####<meld>surprise
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thats better then. ####<meld>neutral
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled. ####<meld>neutral
I see. Have you considered therapy? ####<meld>neutral
I think just the ####<meld>neutral
There are a couple of forms to fill out. ####<meld>neutral
Easy. ####<meld>neutral
And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind. ####<meld>neutral
No problem. ####<meld>neutral
And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh! ####<meld>surprise
Theres no way to do this without her? ####<meld>surprise
Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of. ####<meld>fear
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones. ####<meld>neutral
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game. ####<meld>neutral
Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. ####<meld>neutral
That's alright, I'll take it. ####<meld>neutral
Bad things happen to me anyway. ####<meld>neutral
This way I can break 'em up with a movie. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen... ####<meld>neutral
You wanna do it right now? ####<meld>neutral
Great! ####<meld>joy
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from ####<meld>neutral
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you. ####<meld>neutral
You're welcome. ####<meld>neutral
is for me not to see you anymore. ####<meld>sadness
That's crazy! ####<meld>surprise
You can't do that! ####<meld>surprise
What are you going to tell her? ####<meld>sadness
Oh God. ####<meld>fear
Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you? ####<meld>sadness
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. ####<meld>sadness
And I do, I have to make ####<meld>sadness
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That ####<meld>surprise
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard. ####<meld>sadness
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you. ####<meld>anger
What are you doing? ####<meld>surprise
Storming out! ####<meld>anger
Rachel, this is your apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!! ####<meld>anger

Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. ####<meld>neutral
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker. ####<meld>neutral
You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Chandler! ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift." ####<meld>joy
Oh, well thank you in advance. ####<meld>joy
Op, but the twelfth brings a lovers spat. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself. ####<meld>surprise
Hey guys! ####<meld>neutral
Hey!! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick? ####<meld>joy
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? Ive dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?! ####<meld>joy
No! Joey, youre going to be great! ####<meld>neutral
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything about technology! ####<meld>fear
I cant even use Chandlers computer except to find porn! ####<meld>anger
And-and thats only cause its right there when you turn it on! ####<meld>anger
I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month. ####<meld>anger
Ill be waiting. ####<meld>neutral
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay? ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here. ####<meld>surprise
I know! ####<meld>surprise
Now look, theres only one problem though. ####<meld>joy
Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys. ####<meld>neutral
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no ones fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident. ####<meld>neutral
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
So Rach! ####<meld>joy

This is just Bactine. It won't hurt. ####<meld>neutral
Sorry, that was wax. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner. ####<meld>sadness
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall? ####<meld>disgust
During a blackout? He'd get trampled! ####<meld>sadness
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. ####<meld>sadness
But I'll still always come back, like this. ####<meld>neutral
And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. ####<meld>neutral
But I'll still always come back, like this. ####<meld>neutral
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. ####<meld>neutral
He is so amazing. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I know. Look at him. ####<meld>joy
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name. ####<meld>neutral

Hi Bob! ####<meld>joy
I thought I told you to get outta here! ####<meld>anger
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot. ####<meld>neutral

Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift. ####<meld>joy
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! ####<meld>anger
How can I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? ####<meld>anger
See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it. ####<meld>anger
We are aware of the problem you are referring to. ####<meld>neutral
But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the library is very understaffed. ####<meld>neutral
I, I cant help you. ####<meld>sadness
Well, fine. ####<meld>anger
Fine! ####<meld>anger
If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself! ####<meld>anger
And dont you follow me! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Phoebe look, its Ross and that girl. ####<meld>surprise
No! No! Look at that!  Its a line of ants! Theyre working as a team! ####<meld>surprise

They are not breaking up, look at them. ####<meld>neutral
Okay thats, you know what that is? ####<meld>neutral
That is a, that is a second date, thats what that is! ####<meld>sadness
Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh... ####<meld>neutral

The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time. ####<meld>neutral
You still work at the multiplex? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, like Id give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room. ####<meld>joy

Okay. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no! ####<meld>fear
YES!! ####<meld>joy
Uh fellas, ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so he's out of here. ####<meld>neutral

So you risked your life, for a sandwich! ####<meld>joy
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world! ####<meld>joy
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me. ####<meld>sadness

Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys? ####<meld>fear
Let's see. ####<meld>neutral
Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports. ####<meld>neutral

Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler! ####<meld>surprise

Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back. ####<meld>neutral
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black? ####<meld>neutral
Well, you-you know what I meant. ####<meld>neutral
No, you messed it up. Youre stupid. ####<meld>anger
So what job did you get Joe? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something? ####<meld>neutral

Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a ####<meld>neutral
It just keeps getting worse and worse! ####<meld>anger
I mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows. ####<meld>neutral
Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us. ####<meld>neutral
And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. ####<meld>neutral
And now I have seen her naked. ####<meld>neutral
I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. ####<meld>neutral
But there are no boles, shes smooth! ####<meld>neutral
Smooth! ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
So, you and Angela, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yep. Pretty much. ####<meld>joy
Oh, that's what she meant! ####<meld>surprise
You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! ####<meld>neutral
You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, most of it it's a place ####<meld>neutral
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison    Avenue. ####<meld>neutral
You know what? ####<meld>neutral
She loves architecture, you know what you should do? ####<meld>neutral
You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love. ####<meld>joy
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! ####<meld>surprise
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food... ####<meld>neutral

Sorry, I justcant sleep. ####<meld>surprise
Ooh! ####<meld>anger
Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? ####<meld>neutral
Because every time I look at that cover Im like ####<meld>neutral
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section ####<meld>sadness
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral

Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic isOh my God! ####<meld>surprise
What? What happened to the window in the attic?! ####<meld>surprise
I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house! ####<meld>anger

I cant believe I still dont know what happened to the ####<meld>surprise
Nothing? ####<meld>neutral
Look, you and I have been given a gift. ####<meld>neutral

And-and-and I wrote a song for us! ####<meld>joy
(Singing, to the tune of ####<meld>joy
That's okay. ####<meld>neutral
But you haven't even heard the chorus! ####<meld>neutral
Well, shell understand right? Its not like I did it on purpose. ####<meld>sadness
Dad, that wont matter to her. ####<meld>neutral
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff! ####<meld>anger
See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her. ####<meld>anger
Oh my God, does she really thinks that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, can you blame her? ####<meld>sadness
Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could ####<meld>joy
Dad, dad I dont want to hear about it. ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise

Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want. ####<meld>joy
You could? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat. ####<meld>joy
Your own boat? ####<meld>surprise
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick. ####<meld>surprise
Hes coming here for Thanksgiving! ####<meld>joy
Count in our heads as-as good ####<meld>anger
I guess I'm done. ####<meld>neutral
Fun’s over ####<meld>joy
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something! ####<meld>fear
I think I'm gonna take-off. ####<meld>neutral
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh! ####<meld>joy
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it ####<meld>neutral
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'... ####<meld>neutral
Do you want a date Saturday? ####<meld>neutral
Yes please. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's- ####<meld>neutral

Okay, goodbye... ####<meld>disgust
Well, it's official there are no good movies. ####<meld>sadness
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. ####<meld>neutral
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, man. What's up? ####<meld>neutral
Maybe you can tell me. ####<meld>neutral
My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. ####<meld>anger
The first good thing she gets me in weeks. ####<meld>neutral
How could you not give me the message? ####<meld>anger
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me. ####<meld>anger
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me! ####<meld>anger
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed. ####<meld>neutral
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you? ####<meld>neutral
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie? ####<meld>surprise
Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me. ####<meld>sadness
Whoa! ####<meld>surprise
Whoa what? ####<meld>surprise
Ross has a boyfriend. ####<meld>neutral

I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. ####<meld>anger
What-what-what-what is it?! ####<meld>joy
Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe? ####<meld>anger
Not right now. ####<meld>neutral
It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! ####<meld>sadness
I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! ####<meld>joy
Yknow youI couldnt concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. ####<meld>neutral
I mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in love. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh thats-thats actually how the French drink it. ####<meld>joy
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes! ####<meld>joy

That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now? ####<meld>joy
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6? ####<meld>neutral

Take as much time as you want. ####<meld>neutral
Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. ####<meld>neutral
Ill be here. ####<meld>sadness
Not smoking. ####<meld>sadness
Were really gonna do this, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Looks like it. ####<meld>neutral

Im-Im Ross by the way. ####<meld>neutral
Hello Ross.  I love what youve done with this space. ####<meld>joy
Thank you so much. ####<meld>joy
How hot is this?! ####<meld>surprise
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm ####<meld>neutral
G.I. Joe ####<meld>neutral
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas! ####<meld>joy
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid. ####<meld>sadness
That, that's what's stupid. ####<meld>disgust
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. ####<meld>neutral
And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Down at the docks again? ####<meld>anger
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell? ####<meld>neutral
Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke Sarahs leg. ####<meld>anger
Hey now! That was an accident, okay. ####<meld>anger
Youre a big scrud. ####<meld>anger
Whats a scrud? ####<meld>neutral
Why dont you look in the mirror, scrud. ####<meld>anger
I dont have too. I can just look at you. ####<meld>joy
All right girls, and man. Lets see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice. ####<meld>joy
Not nice enough. ####<meld>anger
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good. ####<meld>neutral
So, howd the lasagne go over? ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Good. ####<meld>neutral
So you owe me three pretty things. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too. ####<meld>neutral
Its hard this whole platonic thing. ####<meld>sadness
Its a word! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I do think its better this way.  Yeah, were being smart.   Yes, Im sure. ####<meld>neutral
You really sure? ####<meld>neutral
Ill call you back. ####<meld>neutral
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man? ####<meld>surprise
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. ####<meld>neutral
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. ####<meld>neutral
I am ####<meld>neutral
I think you're better than you think you are. ####<meld>neutral
Really? Okay, so ####<meld>surprise
Know when to stop. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance. ####<meld>neutral

Thats my job! ####<meld>anger
Are you being British?! ####<meld>surprise
No. Not anymore. ####<meld>neutral
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. ####<meld>neutral
Barley? What kind of party serves barley? ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours. ####<meld>anger
Where is this party? ####<meld>neutral
Here in Chelsea. ####<meld>neutral
Who's party is it? ####<meld>anger
A woman's ####<meld>neutral
What woman?! ####<meld>anger
Chelsea. ####<meld>neutral
Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. ####<meld>disgust
Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. ####<meld>disgust
So like which of these two guys do you want to be? ####<meld>sadness
Can I be that guy? ####<meld>joy
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo! ####<meld>joy
Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going. ####<meld>anger
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay! ####<meld>fear
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you. ####<meld>surprise
Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no! ####<meld>anger
Did you just flick me? ####<meld>anger
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica] ####<meld>joy
Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this! ####<meld>anger
Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts! ####<meld>anger

Ow! Ow! Ow! ####<meld>anger
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop. ####<meld>neutral
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Fine! ####<meld>anger
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise

Thats a great idea! We can ####<meld>joy
Totally! ####<meld>joy
We dont have to come up with this now. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover. ####<meld>neutral
Thats great. Good for you guys. ####<meld>joy
I am not high maintenance! ####<meld>anger
I am not a pushover! ####<meld>anger
Who said you were? ####<meld>neutral
You did! ####<meld>anger
Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do. ####<meld>joy
That does not sound stupid to me. ####<meld>neutral
You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. ####<meld>sadness
Next on Ross... Uh-oh. ####<meld>neutral
What uh-oh? ####<meld>joy

Okay, ####<meld>neutral
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming! ####<meld>anger
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this? ####<meld>disgust
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun? ####<meld>anger
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight! ####<meld>anger
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms? ####<meld>anger
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas! ####<meld>anger
Do not speak ill of the dead. ####<meld>anger
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you? ####<meld>anger
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom. ####<meld>sadness
What did you say? ####<meld>anger
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn." ####<meld>fear
Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Yknow, technically we still ####<meld>neutral
Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a bit? ####<meld>neutral
Kay! ####<meld>neutral
Can I ask you something? ####<meld>neutral

Yes. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks man. ####<meld>neutral
Okay man. ####<meld>neutral
But what about how much taller he is than me? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man? ####<meld>anger
Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour. ####<meld>surprise

Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, yknow what? ####<meld>surprise
Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff. ####<meld>neutral

You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion. ####<meld>neutral

Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get yknow, real  nice and tight. ####<meld>neutral
So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area. ####<meld>surprise

Are you kidding me?! ####<meld>anger
It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?! ####<meld>anger
I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! ####<meld>anger
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you. ####<meld>neutral

Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh. ####<meld>neutral
Is there something wrong? ####<meld>neutral
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? ####<meld>neutral
You're hot. ####<meld>neutral
I'm lovable. ####<meld>neutral
Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. ####<meld>neutral
But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. ####<meld>neutral
Joey... ####<meld>neutral
Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im ####<meld>fear
Ho-oh, hes gonna get some! ####<meld>joy
Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Im off to bed! ####<meld>neutral
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! ####<meld>joy
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny. ####<meld>joy
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! ####<meld>joy
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. ####<meld>fear
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, look I like you. ####<meld>fear
I-I really do, I like you a lot. ####<meld>fear
Okay? ####<meld>anger
But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very ####<meld>joy
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, Joey! Sorry! ####<meld>surprise
They made you head of the department! ####<meld>joy
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didnt I get head of the department? ####<meld>joy
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant? ####<meld>neutral

Ooh, I miss dating. ####<meld>sadness
Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. ####<meld>neutral
Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun! ####<meld>joy
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
Why dont I take you out? ####<meld>neutral
What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady. ####<meld>surprise
Yes I do! ####<meld>joy
And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out ####<meld>joy
Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya. ####<meld>joy
Ill be fun. ####<meld>neutral
All right? ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good ####<meld>joy
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow! ####<meld>joy
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me? ####<meld>surprise
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Oh screw her, that part is mine! ####<meld>anger
Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here. ####<meld>surprise
I can't believe you married him. ####<meld>surprise
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a ####<meld>anger
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other. ####<meld>sadness
It's over! You ####<meld>joy
How can I? ####<meld>surprise
Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? ####<meld>sadness
How can I accept that... ####<meld>sadness
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now. ####<meld>sadness
Kiss me. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for? ####<meld>joy
The bigger half. ####<meld>neutral
I'd like to propose a toast. ####<meld>joy
Little toast here, ding ding. ####<meld>joy
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. ####<meld>joy
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? ####<meld>anger
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. ####<meld>joy
That's so sweet. ####<meld>joy
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. ####<meld>joy
And a crappy New Year. ####<meld>joy
Here, here! ####<meld>joy
Now, hold on! ####<meld>anger
Hold on! ####<meld>anger
Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that Im gonna be at that airport and I hope that shell be there too! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah, I said Rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay? ####<meld>anger
Shes-shes just a friend and thats all! ####<meld>anger
Thats all! ####<meld>sadness
Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else. ####<meld>anger
Please, promise me that youll tell her that. ####<meld>sadness
All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face! ####<meld>anger
Call me. ####<meld>neutral
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window! ####<meld>anger
What happened?!! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I dont know!! ####<meld>surprise
We fell asleep! That is all. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go. ####<meld>neutral
I think that would be best. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. But not about this! ####<meld>anger
No! Never! Never!  Bye. ####<meld>anger
No touch! No touch! ####<meld>neutral
Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
It’s a funny story, actually. ####<meld>neutral
I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying. ####<meld>neutral
You fell asleep? ####<meld>surprise
But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny? ####<meld>fear
Irony? ####<meld>surprise
Not a fan, alright . ####<meld>neutral
See, here’s  the thing. ####<meld>neutral
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. ####<meld>neutral
See, me, I  love Tulsa! ####<meld>joy
Tulsa is heaven! ####<meld>joy
Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go  there! ####<meld>fear
Chandler, I… ####<meld>joy
No no no! ####<meld>fear
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? ####<meld>neutral
Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine? ####<meld>joy
Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping! ####<meld>joy
That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it,  well she’s lovely. ####<meld>joy
I like a girl with a strong jaw. ####<meld>sadness
I’ll call you from Tulsa. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
How are you? ####<meld>neutral
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here? ####<meld>neutral
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. ####<meld>neutral
That I was not expecting. ####<meld>surprise
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing ####<meld>joy
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'. ####<meld>neutral
I just can't believe you're in here. ####<meld>surprise
I mean, what am I gonna do without you? ####<meld>sadness
Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? ####<meld>sadness
Who's gonna take me to the ####<meld>sadness
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid. ####<meld>disgust
What do you mean? ####<meld>neutral
Smell familiar? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no. ####<meld>fear
Oh, I am so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
No me, I am so sorry... ####<meld>sadness
Oh my. ####<meld>surprise
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. ####<meld>fear
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. ####<meld>fear
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles. ####<meld>neutral
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea? ####<meld>neutral
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. ####<meld>neutral
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. ####<meld>neutral
Tho? ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh. ####<meld>fear
That's good, have a seat. ####<meld>neutral
Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. ####<meld>neutral
You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? ####<meld>neutral
Can you do that for me? ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! ####<meld>fear
All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. ####<meld>neutral
Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! ####<meld>anger
Let go of my hand! ####<meld>anger
Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?! ####<meld>joy
Welllets just say ####<meld>neutral
Oo, where are the seats? ####<meld>joy
Uh, middle balcony. ####<meld>neutral
Youre a mean old woman. ####<meld>anger
No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook! ####<meld>sadness
Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay? ####<meld>surprise
Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. ####<meld>joy
Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity! ####<meld>joy
Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love! ####<meld>joy
That means nothing to me.  Come on! ####<meld>anger
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger. ####<meld>fear
: What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Ummm. Oh! Im sorry.  Its a little old but ####<meld>joy
: No! Youre clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging! ####<meld>anger
Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot. ####<meld>sadness
: Oh yeah, of course you dont! ####<meld>anger
: Cause youre a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of ####<meld>disgust
: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? ####<meld>anger
Well, why dont think of someone else for a change? ####<meld>anger
Okay, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Hello! ####<meld>joy
What's this? ####<meld>neutral
Oh right its that girl's phone number. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. ####<meld>joy
It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! ####<meld>surprise
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. ####<meld>anger
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
I dont know how any of these got opened?! ####<meld>surprise
You opened them all? ####<meld>surprise
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again! ####<meld>joy
Oh hey! You got my parents gift! ####<meld>joy
Yeah. What is that? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! Howd it go? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. What-what did Tag say? ####<meld>neutral
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now? ####<meld>sadness
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. ####<meld>joy
Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra! ####<meld>surprise
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is? ####<meld>neutral
No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youre not gonna be alone in this. ####<meld>joy
Im not? ####<meld>surprise
Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom. ####<meld>fear
Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. ####<meld>neutral
So,  Rachel Green will you marry me? ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
If I cant have it you cant have it! ####<meld>anger
I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical. ####<meld>disgust
Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. ####<meld>neutral
There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and ####<meld>neutral
Paris? ####<meld>neutral
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la . ####<meld>neutral
Keep talking. ####<meld>neutral
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can! ####<meld>joy
I love you! ####<meld>joy
Yes! ####<meld>joy
I win again! ####<meld>joy
Ha-ha! ####<meld>joy
Thats like 500 bucks you owe me! ####<meld>joy
Whoo-ho-hoo! ####<meld>joy

Whoo-ho-ho! ####<meld>joy

Okay, get ready to owe me! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, here we go. Ready? ####<meld>neutral
No! No! No! Noone can beat me. ####<meld>anger
See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. ####<meld>fear
Who is that?! ####<meld>surprise
Dont worry, Im brave! ####<meld>sadness
I am brave! ####<meld>fear
II am brave! ####<meld>fear
No-no-no-no!! ####<meld>fear

So, can I get some candy? ####<meld>neutral

Um-hmm. ####<meld>neutral
Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you! ####<meld>surprise
Mm! Night Gar! ####<meld>neutral
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered! ####<meld>joy
Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting. ####<meld>neutral
You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork? ####<meld>neutral
So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day. ####<meld>neutral
Well have we finished the scene? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! Youyou were wonderful. ####<meld>joy

So I got your car, its right outside. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thank you. Youre welcome. ####<meld>joy
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go. ####<meld>fear
Is that my ass? ####<meld>joy
What about these? These look the same? ####<meld>neutral
Definitely! ####<meld>joy
Not as each other! ####<meld>neutral
Oh, then no. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>anger
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier. ####<meld>joy
Let me see the earrings. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, honey, the earrings ####<meld>neutral
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what? ####<meld>joy
My boyfriend really does have good taste! ####<meld>joy
Thanks for picking out the earrings man. ####<meld>neutral
Mm-Hm ####<meld>neutral
I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Look at this! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, but there ####<meld>neutral
I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head! ####<meld>anger
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did. ####<meld>neutral
And did you?! ####<meld>sadness
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs. ####<meld>neutral
But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Hello darling. ####<meld>neutral
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, is everybody clear? Were gonna pick it upand move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna ####<meld>neutral

Lift!! And slide! ####<meld>joy
Okay, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
All right everyone, lift!  And slide!! ####<meld>joy

Another ####<meld>neutral
Thats right! And what are you not gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
Well, Im not gonna talk because ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but ####<meld>sadness
Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand. ####<meld>sadness
I-I am so sorry, Ill go. ####<meld>sadness
Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. ####<meld>sadness
Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper. ####<meld>neutral
I found my identical hand twin! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, you are ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>neutral
But she just came up here! ####<meld>surprise
That was Joey! ####<meld>neutral
I wonder where she is. That is so weird. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard. ####<meld>neutral
Would you stop that! ####<meld>anger
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? ####<meld>neutral
She didn't feel anything for him. ####<meld>neutral
She loves you! ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her. ####<meld>anger
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Good.  I should really start wearing hats! ####<meld>neutral
I mean, why should I let them meet him? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. ####<meld>disgust
I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. ####<meld>joy
Listen. ####<meld>neutral
As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. ####<meld>neutral
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. ####<meld>sadness
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no.  Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye. ####<meld>neutral
Hey sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering? ####<meld>neutral
I cant tell you. Its a secret. ####<meld>neutral
Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another. ####<meld>anger
Awww.  But still no. ####<meld>neutral
No Im serious, we should tell each other ####<meld>neutral
Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at ####<meld>neutral

If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral

Oh! You got it?! ####<meld>sadness
Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good. ####<meld>joy
What was it for? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, its this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. ####<meld>neutral
Its really classy! ####<meld>joy
Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese. ####<meld>joy

Grandmas gonna have to get in line. ####<meld>joy
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me! ####<meld>joy
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson. ####<meld>surprise
Who? ####<meld>neutral
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyones name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. ####<meld>neutral
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, no. No. ####<meld>neutral
Yes you did! What was it? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, its Cutie McPretty. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh thats so sweet! ####<meld>joy
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Im having a great time! ####<meld>joy
Yknow how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but its not. ####<meld>surprise
I mean its not at all. ####<meld>neutral
Dr. Geller! ####<meld>joy
Burt! ####<meld>joy
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, shoot. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial. ####<meld>neutral
I didn't get it? ####<meld>neutral
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that. ####<meld>joy
Okay, what else? ####<meld>neutral
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.' ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>sadness
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.' ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral

Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe, what are you doing? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me. ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that. ####<meld>disgust
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything. ####<meld>joy
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles? ####<meld>surprise
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her? ####<meld>surprise
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order. ####<meld>disgust
What are you saying I should do? ####<meld>neutral
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, Monica. ####<meld>joy
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine. ####<meld>surprise
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper! ####<meld>joy
Ooh, lets see it! ####<meld>joy

Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine. ####<meld>neutral
So then you know? ####<meld>joy

Well, you know, no suds, no save. ####<meld>neutral
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine. ####<meld>anger
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. ####<meld>anger
Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine! ####<meld>anger
Well, I think this is a great place to work! ####<meld>joy
Ok, are they listening? ####<meld>anger

This is the first time in my life Im doing something that Im actually good at. ####<meld>anger
I mean. ####<meld>neutral
if you dont get that... ####<meld>anger
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. ####<meld>anger
And Im happy for ya, but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I dont know what to do anymore. ####<meld>sadness

Oh, yeah! How did you meet her? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, which museum? ####<meld>neutral
No, answer his. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. ####<meld>joy
She was totally at my mercy. ####<meld>joy
Were you so late because you were burring this woman? ####<meld>sadness
No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. ####<meld>neutral
She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away. ####<meld>joy
How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany. ####<meld>anger
Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now? ####<meld>joy
No, there is no way! It can ####<meld>joy

He cannot play at our wedding! ####<meld>anger

If you listen very carefully, I think its ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes! ####<meld>surprise
So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, sure. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they? ####<meld>neutral
Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over? ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
You see, now, I would date this girl. ####<meld>neutral
Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, thats got to come in handy ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Me neither. ####<meld>neutral
Rachel. ####<meld>neutral

I dont know.  Me neither. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I wanted to tell Im-Im sorry you lost. ####<meld>sadness

Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island? ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten ####<meld>surprise
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island. ####<meld>surprise
Also an island. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, what time is it? ####<meld>neutral
2:17. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? ####<meld>surprise
Are you serious?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose! ####<meld>anger
Hey, you guys ####<meld>neutral

And shame on all of you! ####<meld>disgust
Youre disgusting! ####<meld>disgust
Especially you  with that! ####<meld>disgust
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Are you moving out? ####<meld>neutral
No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's. ####<meld>neutral
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec? ####<meld>neutral
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over. ####<meld>neutral
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um, ####<meld>fear
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs... ####<meld>joy
Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. ####<meld>neutral
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies ####<meld>neutral
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. ####<meld>surprise
Which proves that I never lie. ####<meld>neutral
I guess you don't. ####<meld>neutral
Paolo made a pass at me. ####<meld>sadness
Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out. ####<meld>fear
Im not freaking out. ####<meld>neutral
Why would I be freaking out? ####<meld>neutral
A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. ####<meld>neutral
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! ####<meld>anger
I mean, whats the harm in that? ####<meld>neutral
Right here! ####<meld>sadness
Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel ####<meld>anger
Phoebe and Rachel! ####<meld>anger
So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way! ####<meld>sadness
It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt. ####<meld>sadness
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>joy
Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready ####<meld>neutral
I know! I know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you. ####<meld>anger
Hey, did she buy it? ####<meld>neutral
Totally. ####<meld>neutral
So did Heldi show you the place? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, its beautiful. ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you! ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay look, I have an idea. ####<meld>neutral
Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. ####<meld>neutral
And then whoever does gets the phone. ####<meld>neutral
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide. ####<meld>sadness
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin. ####<meld>sadness
Did I use that already today? Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I win! Hes got ####<meld>joy
So you dont know thats ####<meld>neutral
His new girlfriend! ####<meld>surprise
I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. ####<meld>sadness
Shes saving the rest for her divorce. ####<meld>anger
And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to ####<meld>neutral
Well what happened at dinner? ####<meld>neutral
My parents spent the money for our wedding! ####<meld>anger
My God! What did you order?! ####<meld>surprise
Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center! ####<meld>sadness
Honey, its gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies! ####<meld>sadness
No, yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
Its gonna be okay. ####<meld>neutral
I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. ####<meld>neutral
Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. ####<meld>neutral
Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me. ####<meld>neutral
I will sit with you Dr. Geller. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. ####<meld>neutral
Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division. ####<meld>sadness
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" ####<meld>fear
Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. ####<meld>neutral
Im Ross! ####<meld>joy
Im divorced, and I have a kid! ####<meld>joy
Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs! ####<meld>joy
Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me. ####<meld>anger
All right, there you go! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy! ####<meld>anger
Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, good-good for you. ####<meld>joy
Im Rhonda,  and these arent real! ####<meld>neutral
Wow, Rhonda. ####<meld>surprise
Im Scott. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, okay, Scott! ####<meld>neutral
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die. ####<meld>fear
So thanks for the warm welcome. ####<meld>neutral
Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. ####<meld>joy
I hope you do too. ####<meld>neutral
Now, lets go out there and get em! ####<meld>joy
And remember, there is no I in team. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody ####<meld>joy
You! Chuckles! Whats your name? ####<meld>neutral
Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah... ####<meld>fear
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. ####<meld>neutral
I like funny. ####<meld>joy
This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun. ####<meld>joy
Good to have you aboard Bing! ####<meld>joy
Yeah. You won't be able to take it. ####<meld>neutral
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her? ####<meld>neutral
They're gonna call her Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think? ####<meld>neutral
Works on you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that is so sweet. ####<meld>joy
No, no, ok, you hang up. ####<meld>joy
Ok, ok, one, two, three. ####<meld>joy
Well you didn't hang up either. ####<meld>joy

You're over me? ####<meld>surprise
Ohhhhhhhh God. ####<meld>surprise
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me? ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, ohh. ####<meld>sadness
When, when were you... under me? ####<meld>surprise
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. ####<meld>neutral
OK, I need to lie down. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition! ####<meld>joy
Really? That's great! ####<meld>joy
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her ####<meld>joy
(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, ####<meld>joy
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. ####<meld>joy
Ben is way cuter than that kid. ####<meld>joy
I mean look at him, look at you, ####<meld>disgust
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad? ####<meld>neutral
Joey, you look nothing like Ben. ####<meld>neutral
I look more like him than you do! ####<meld>anger
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that. ####<meld>joy
That really was some of your best work. ####<meld>joy
Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work. ####<meld>neutral
I have to be up in seven minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Do you wanna? ####<meld>neutral
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish! ####<meld>joy
Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back. ####<meld>neutral
Boyfriend? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Im Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Kristen. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again? ####<meld>joy
Kristen. ####<meld>neutral
Got it!  So ####<meld>neutral
So uh, do you live around here? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Right down there. ####<meld>neutral
Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip. ####<meld>neutral
Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone. ####<meld>joy
Ill remember that. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Oh I, I have plans tonight. ####<meld>neutral
But how about tomorrow? ####<meld>neutral
Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? ####<meld>joy
You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, um... ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
: Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' ####<meld>neutral
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you! ####<meld>sadness
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work. ####<meld>neutral
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her? ####<meld>neutral
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me. ####<meld>anger
You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over. ####<meld>sadness
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hello liar. ####<meld>anger
Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike. ####<meld>sadness
I couldve been killed I hope you know! ####<meld>anger
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were ####<meld>sadness
Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
What?!  What the hell?! ####<meld>anger
All right, yknow what? ####<meld>anger
If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back. ####<meld>anger
What?! Why?! ####<meld>surprise
Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar ####<meld>anger
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. ####<meld>anger
Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy. ####<meld>joy
Okay Ross!  Please dont die! ####<meld>anger
How could you have kept all of this from me? ####<meld>fear
I was going to tell you, but ####<meld>neutral
But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel! ####<meld>anger
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that? ####<meld>anger
Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it. ####<meld>neutral
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down. ####<meld>neutral
Everything on your application looks really goodOhh! ####<meld>joy
Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out? ####<meld>anger
Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay? ####<meld>joy
You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here. ####<meld>joy
Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it. ####<meld>sadness
Why did you take the shower curtain down? ####<meld>surprise
That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious. ####<meld>fear
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey man, how did the audition go? ####<meld>neutral
Estelle said I didn't get it. ####<meld>sadness
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me. ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>surprise
For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around. ####<meld>neutral
No, from now on, Im staying in one place. ####<meld>neutral
Right here. ####<meld>neutral
Well, its getting late. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, were gonna go. ####<meld>neutral
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while? ####<meld>neutral
Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, its a very large plane. ####<meld>neutral
Thats cool. ####<meld>neutral
But, well stay here with you. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt. ####<meld>joy
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood. ####<meld>surprise
Theyre not a couple! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-okay, I get the game now. ####<meld>neutral
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
Well okay, so then youre fine. ####<meld>neutral
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. ####<meld>neutral
Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Noooo!! ####<meld>neutral
Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye. ####<meld>neutral
Wait a second! So, whats new with you? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week. ####<meld>neutral
And your breasts! Hmm!!! ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Umm look, youre coming on a little strong. ####<meld>fear
But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. ####<meld>neutral
So, why dont we just start over okay? ####<meld>neutral
And you can just tell me about yourself. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I write erotic novels, for children. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Theyre wildly unpopular. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>disgust
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! You do? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah,  a Pretty Huge ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>disgust
So, uh, how's she doing? ####<meld>sadness
The doctor says it's a matter of hours. ####<meld>sadness
How-how are you, Mom? ####<meld>sadness
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair? ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
What's different? ####<meld>surprise
Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, maybe that's it. ####<meld>neutral
She is unbelievable, our mother is... ####<meld>anger
Okay, relax, relax. ####<meld>neutral
We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God! ####<meld>surprise
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
...Yeah, they were gross. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, you know what I loved? ####<meld>joy
Her Sweet 'n' Los. ####<meld>joy
How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants. ####<meld>joy
Not just restaurants, from our house. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe. ####<meld>neutral
You can't! ####<meld>surprise
Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said. ####<meld>surprise
In the hall. ####<meld>neutral
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. ####<meld>neutral
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. ####<meld>neutral
Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys. ####<meld>neutral
That's a good one! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Dad, Ronni's here. ####<meld>neutral
Huh? ####<meld>surprise
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. ####<meld>neutral
Anything at all. ####<meld>neutral
But these are the three that Monica pre-approved. ####<meld>neutral
Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest. ####<meld>joy
Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me! ####<meld>anger
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi! ####<meld>anger
Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom? ####<meld>neutral
Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A ####<meld>anger
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers. ####<meld>sadness
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple? ####<meld>joy
Okay, youre fine. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?! ####<meld>surprise
Youll see. ####<meld>neutral
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen. ####<meld>joy
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles ####<meld>neutral
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go. ####<meld>neutral
But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time. ####<meld>neutral
Really, its fine, whatever you want. ####<meld>neutral
Its perfect. ####<meld>joy
And, I dont know, if it starts to rain ####<meld>joy
Well then well get wet. ####<meld>anger
Ohh. And I dont even have a date. ####<meld>sadness
Coming. ####<meld>neutral
I have a bone to pick with you. ####<meld>anger
Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear
Yes! Ben learned a little trick. ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old ####<meld>surprise
Thats right! Thats right! ####<meld>joy
Oh that. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them! ####<meld>anger
Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true! ####<meld>anger
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
And if it were true, how ####<meld>neutral
Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go. ####<meld>neutral
Mark's a genius! ####<meld>surprise
Why?! How?! How is he a genius? ####<meld>surprise
Look, don't you see what's happening here. ####<meld>anger
Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. ####<meld>anger
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you. ####<meld>neutral
What am I going to do? ####<meld>fear
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. ####<meld>neutral
All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits. ####<meld>neutral
I don't know you guys. ####<meld>fear
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. ####<meld>disgust
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' ####<meld>disgust
And before you know it, she's with him. ####<meld>anger
And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' ####<meld>anger
And he'll be all, 'Yes!' ####<meld>anger
And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' ####<meld>joy
And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' ####<meld>disgust
And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' ####<meld>disgust
He paints quite a picture doesn't he? ####<meld>neutral
This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor. ####<meld>neutral
Great. Great. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud. ####<meld>neutral
Ill be there. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes! ####<meld>neutral
Okay! Well need a six-pack of ####<meld>neutral
Hey guys, what are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, come on! ####<meld>sadness
Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there. ####<meld>neutral
And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot. ####<meld>neutral
What do ya say? What do ya say? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. ####<meld>neutral
But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk. ####<meld>neutral
I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid! ####<meld>sadness
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. ####<meld>sadness
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! ####<meld>surprise
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... ####<meld>joy
What's that supposed to mean? ####<meld>surprise
Nothing! It's an expression. ####<meld>neutral
No it's not. ####<meld>neutral
Don't listen to your mother. ####<meld>neutral
You're independent, and you always have been! ####<meld>neutral
Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! ####<meld>neutral
And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... ####<meld>neutral
PBS Telethon. ####<meld>neutral
Hi Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
I ####<meld>neutral
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not ####<meld>anger
What kind of problem? ####<meld>surprise
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag! ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway! ####<meld>sadness
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag. ####<meld>sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag. ####<meld>sadness
I don't have to give up the bag! ####<meld>anger
Do I Rach? ####<meld>sadness
Oh, you think I should give up the bag! ####<meld>anger
Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it ####<meld>neutral
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag. ####<meld>sadness
I can't believe I'm hearing this! ####<meld>sadness
Wait a minute! ####<meld>sadness
Wait a minute! ####<meld>anger
I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah umm, they're called wallets. ####<meld>neutral
I think you'll find this room more to your liking. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, great. ####<meld>joy
They say he's only got half a tank left. ####<meld>neutral
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do! ####<meld>surprise
We're switching rooms again. ####<meld>anger
What? Why? ####<meld>surprise
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room. ####<meld>anger
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you. ####<meld>joy
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second? ####<meld>anger
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler! ####<meld>neutral
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!! ####<meld>anger
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!! ####<meld>anger
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you? ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming. ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I wouldnt miss this. ####<meld>joy
Well, Im very glad youre here. ####<meld>joy
Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey. ####<meld>neutral
So are guys doing okay? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important. ####<meld>neutral
Do you have a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Well yeah, sure, whats up? ####<meld>neutral
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys. ####<meld>neutral
Oh really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, did you not want people to know that? ####<meld>joy
But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay. ####<meld>joy
Whys that? ####<meld>neutral
I dont think I should say. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Kay. ####<meld>neutral
Well ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, shes gay. ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Great! All right, so Ill call you later. ####<meld>joy
Great! ####<meld>joy
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that? ####<meld>surprise
That would be Casey. Were going out tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer. ####<meld>surprise
No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! ####<meld>anger
Wait! Youre going out with Kathy! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset? ####<meld>surprise
Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. ####<meld>disgust
What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive. ####<meld>sadness
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. ####<meld>anger
But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you. ####<meld>neutral
You got all that from the back of her head? ####<meld>surprise
All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane. ####<meld>neutral
Whos Elaine? ####<meld>neutral
Can you people not see me?! ####<meld>joy
So, will you talk to him? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free ####<meld>anger
One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back! ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? ####<meld>neutral
We need a porn break. ####<meld>neutral
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again. ####<meld>neutral
Well, so, why dont you just turn it off? ####<meld>joy
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Well, what-what cha got there? ####<meld>joy
Oh this, well Im glad you asked. ####<meld>joy
Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? ####<meld>disgust
Ahh! ####<meld>neutral
Now, I know what youre thinking ####<meld>neutral
Pregnant Woman Slays Four? ####<meld>fear
Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they? ####<meld>surprise
No! ####<meld>joy
Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan. ####<meld>neutral
Whats the second part of your plan? ####<meld>neutral
Yes thats right. ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>surprise
I tired attacking two women, did not work. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends. ####<meld>neutral
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them. ####<meld>anger
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?! ####<meld>anger
Oh, no! ####<meld>surprise
No-no! ####<meld>surprise
No, I tired! ####<meld>surprise
But I couldnt. ####<meld>neutral
Thats why Im here. ####<meld>anger
Maybe we could attack them together? ####<meld>neutral
That-thats a no. ####<meld>neutral
What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross! ####<meld>sadness
Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross! ####<meld>anger
I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game! ####<meld>anger
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you. ####<meld>anger
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything. ####<meld>neutral
No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain. ####<meld>neutral
I like that. ####<meld>joy
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. ####<meld>neutral
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
One swift kick and hell back off. ####<meld>neutral
All right, bad ankle, got it! ####<meld>neutral
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay! ####<meld>joy
And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp. ####<meld>neutral
But-but, Liams on my team. ####<meld>joy
I dont care! You just get him! ####<meld>anger
Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! ####<meld>joy
The Red Ross! Okay. ####<meld>joy
Oh!  Oh by the way? ####<meld>neutral
Uh-hmm. ####<meld>neutral
James Brolin? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay. ####<meld>neutral
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Hello, is Ross there? ####<meld>neutral
Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try. ####<meld>neutral
Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking! ####<meld>joy
Oh!  Shes growing inside you. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Wow that was a big one. ####<meld>surprise
I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me. ####<meld>joy
Oh hey you guys! ####<meld>joy
Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going? ####<meld>neutral
I have a job interview I have to get ready for. ####<meld>neutral
I thought you already have a job. ####<meld>neutral
And people say you dont pay attention. ####<meld>neutral
No, this is a much better job. ####<meld>neutral
Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! How do you know how to do that?! ####<meld>surprise
Thats what I do now. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey, come taste this. ####<meld>neutral
What is it? ####<meld>neutral
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge! ####<meld>anger
You cooked him? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! ####<meld>joy
"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica." ####<meld>joy
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya? ####<meld>sadness
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet? ####<meld>neutral
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together. ####<meld>disgust
Were never gonna find anybody. ####<meld>sadness
Well then let me do it! ####<meld>joy
Joe ####<meld>joy
No-no-no! ####<meld>neutral
Look, Ive been thinking about it. ####<meld>neutral
Im an actor right? ####<meld>neutral
So I wont get nervous talking in front of people. ####<meld>neutral
I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts! ####<meld>anger
Everyone knows Im an ass man! ####<meld>joy
That is true. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. ####<meld>joy
Itll be me! ####<meld>joy
And I swear Ill do a really good job. ####<meld>joy
Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me. ####<meld>joy
It might be kinda cool. ####<meld>joy
So I can do it? ####<meld>joy
Ah-ha! Too cocky! ####<meld>joy
I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours. ####<meld>fear
Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place. ####<meld>neutral
What the hell is that? ####<meld>anger
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing? ####<meld>surprise
You said there was a gas leak in here. ####<meld>neutral
Well why dont you use your key? ####<meld>neutral
Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded. ####<meld>neutral
If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. ####<meld>neutral
Come on! ####<meld>anger
Hurry up. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! We could have done that. ####<meld>neutral
Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Im so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Um, and maybe Im wrong! ####<meld>sadness
I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more. ####<meld>neutral
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him? ####<meld>surprise
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, but its made her so happy. ####<meld>anger
Little girl misses her cat. ####<meld>neutral
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
I ####<meld>neutral
He is right, isnt he? ####<meld>joy
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong. ####<meld>neutral
You think? ####<meld>surprise
Oh-no, hes right. ####<meld>neutral
Seven hundred bucks! ####<meld>joy
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? ####<meld>joy
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. ####<meld>joy
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing? ####<meld>neutral
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? ####<meld>disgust
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know those are a delicacy in India. ####<meld>neutral
Me too. ####<meld>neutral
Although this city is my home, so. ####<meld>neutral
So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, you make something up. ####<meld>neutral
Nice,  thank you. ####<meld>joy
This is me. ####<meld>neutral
Here. ####<meld>neutral
Your eyes are very pretty. ####<meld>joy
Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you! ####<meld>joy
He would like to kiss you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now. ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no!! ####<meld>joy
Not him, you dont! ####<meld>surprise
Well the moments over. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Oy! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice? ####<meld>anger
Id really prefer a mountain bike. ####<meld>neutral
Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. ####<meld>surprise
Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum. ####<meld>anger
Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, you want something serious. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. ####<meld>neutral
Those are dead serious. ####<meld>neutral
All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever. ####<meld>anger
No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant. ####<meld>fear
Why not?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is... ####<meld>neutral
What is the thing? ####<meld>sadness
Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
They were in his office. ####<meld>neutral
Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me. ####<meld>sadness
Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk. ####<meld>anger
Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready? ####<meld>joy
How are you feeling? ####<meld>neutral
You are ####<meld>neutral
I really wish that you wouldnt. ####<meld>anger
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? ####<meld>neutral
Then we can put you in bed, okay? ####<meld>neutral
Just smile and dont talk to ####<meld>neutral
Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh? ####<meld>joy
Pheebs!! ####<meld>joy
Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet! ####<meld>joy
Speech! Come on Monica! ####<meld>joy
Come on! ####<meld>joy
Come on! Speech! ####<meld>joy
Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second! ####<meld>anger
Oh-ho, I think its nice. ####<meld>joy
Well you have to because maybe its stupid. ####<meld>neutral
Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with. ####<meld>joy
Oh crap! ####<meld>anger
All right. ####<meld>neutral
The super couldnt figure out what it did. ####<meld>neutral
A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did. ####<meld>sadness
Ive had seven pretty serious shocks. ####<meld>sadness
I officially give up. ####<meld>disgust
Thank God. ####<meld>joy
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing. ####<meld>joy
See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it. ####<meld>anger
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two? ####<meld>sadness
He doesn't have anyone. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible. ####<meld>anger
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! ####<meld>joy
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. ####<meld>neutral
You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. ####<meld>neutral
No way, forget it. ####<meld>joy
C'mon, she's your mom! ####<meld>anger
Exactly. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! ####<meld>joy
I love her books! ####<meld>joy
I cannot get on a plane without one! ####<meld>joy
I mean, this is so cool! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.' ####<meld>disgust
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast. ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
And a nice hot cider for Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser? ####<meld>surprise
Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry! ####<meld>surprise
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? ####<meld>neutral
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree! ####<meld>anger
Yeah I can, it worked real well. ####<meld>neutral
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again. ####<meld>anger
I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette. ####<meld>anger
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em. ####<meld>anger
Who are you talking too? ####<meld>surprise
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree. ####<meld>disgust
I am ####<meld>neutral
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!! ####<meld>anger
I-I'm sorry! Sorry. ####<meld>fear
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup! ####<meld>neutral
Shh! Get me out of here. ####<meld>fear
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
Come here, check this out! ####<meld>surprise
What? Is it the comet? ####<meld>neutral
No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here. ####<meld>surprise
Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, theres ####<meld>neutral
Show me where? ####<meld>neutral
Right-right up here. ####<meld>neutral
Joey wheres the pipe that was holding the door open? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know!   Yeah, I do. ####<meld>joy
Joey! ####<meld>anger
What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid ####<meld>anger
Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! ####<meld>anger
Oh no! No! No! ####<meld>surprise
Wow! This place is incredible!  Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
Im Trudie. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
You must be Bens mum. ####<meld>neutral
Why else would I be here? ####<meld>neutral
Do sit down. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Hi.. how was the game? ####<meld>neutral
Well.. ####<meld>neutral
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! ####<meld>joy
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? ####<meld>surprise
Alan. ####<meld>neutral
He was unbelievable. ####<meld>joy
He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-... ####<meld>joy
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. ####<meld>joy
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. ####<meld>joy
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
..I dunno, a little too Alan? ####<meld>neutral
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. ####<meld>joy
I personally could have a gallon of Alan. ####<meld>joy
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade, ####<meld>joy
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself? ####<meld>fear
What the hell! ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, this was a stupid idea. ####<meld>disgust
My God! ####<meld>surprise
These pants are burning up! ####<meld>surprise
Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! ####<meld>surprise
What is she trying to kill me? ####<meld>anger
It's like a volcano in here! ####<meld>surprise
Are you hot? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, it must just be me then. ####<meld>neutral
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom? ####<meld>neutral
You're driving me crazy with that! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I'll stop. ####<meld>neutral
Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot! ####<meld>anger
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now. ####<meld>anger
You wanna play? ####<meld>neutral
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. ####<meld>neutral
And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule. ####<meld>neutral
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home. ####<meld>neutral
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch? ####<meld>joy
I'm intrigued. ####<meld>neutral
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts. ####<meld>joy
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle? ####<meld>neutral
Uh yeah, right here. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? ####<meld>joy
What's that? ####<meld>neutral
Weeeell, it's rum, and- ####<meld>neutral
I'm sure they'll be here soon. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this. ####<meld>neutral
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station. ####<meld>neutral
You are really frightening me. ####<meld>fear
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple? ####<meld>fear
All right, ten centimeters, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
All right, honey, time to start pushing. ####<meld>neutral
But they're not here yet! ####<meld>fear
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, god. ####<meld>fear
Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that. ####<meld>neutral
Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you. ####<meld>joy
And I mean-Im having a lot of fun. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun. ####<meld>neutral
Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right? ####<meld>joy
So where-where is it going? ####<meld>neutral
Ah! ####<meld>surprise
Thats-thats the real question. ####<meld>neutral
And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun. ####<meld>joy
Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger. ####<meld>neutral
No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou ####<meld>fear
Im sorry, so umm, so where are we? ####<meld>sadness
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. ####<meld>joy
I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . ####<meld>joy
No? ####<meld>anger
Really? ####<meld>surprise
They taste so good. ####<meld>joy
Drum roll. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John? ####<meld>neutral
Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney. ####<meld>neutral
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse. ####<meld>neutral
Youre actually going through with this? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. ####<meld>anger
Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson. ####<meld>neutral
You got problems because of you! ####<meld>anger
Not your name! ####<meld>sadness
All right, this has got to stop! ####<meld>anger
Chandler is a great name! ####<meld>anger
In factyes,  Im, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell! ####<meld>surprise
It was. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me. ####<meld>sadness
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa. That was really good. ####<meld>surprise
Thanks, any suggestions? ####<meld>neutral
You-youyou had sex with Ursula?! ####<meld>surprise
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and ####<meld>fear
You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?! ####<meld>surprise
Well I was just so excited to see you. ####<meld>sadness
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird. ####<meld>disgust
No-no its not! ####<meld>sadness
I dont want to lose you! ####<meld>fear
Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird. ####<meld>sadness
So I guess this is it. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, so do you. ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross? ####<meld>neutral
Manhattan does not have enough stores. ####<meld>sadness
Well, ####<meld>neutral
You can? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Um-hmm. ####<meld>neutral
And a small piece of chocolate. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship ####<meld>sadness
I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be! ####<meld>fear
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon. ####<meld>joy
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time. ####<meld>sadness
I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas! ####<meld>disgust
Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris? ####<meld>surprise
No! No! Not, Paris. ####<meld>neutral
Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona? ####<meld>joy
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen! ####<meld>anger
When? ####<meld>anger
I dont know exactly. ####<meld>neutral
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes. ####<meld>sadness
But I do know that its some time tomorrow. ####<meld>joy
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him! ####<meld>joy
Great! Go get him. ####<meld>joy
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first. ####<meld>neutral
Hes not really my type. ####<meld>neutral
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything. ####<meld>neutral
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks. ####<meld>sadness
You do attract some stinkers. ####<meld>sadness
Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a ####<meld>neutral
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, listen. ####<meld>neutral
If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. ####<meld>neutral
Really. ####<meld>joy
Nothing at all. ####<meld>neutral
Really. ####<meld>joy
Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine? ####<meld>neutral
Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one? ####<meld>sadness
No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out? ####<meld>neutral
No, no, I keep trying, yknow? ####<meld>anger
I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom." ####<meld>sadness
He may think Im sick. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with! ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them. ####<meld>neutral
Thats it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time? ####<meld>joy
Pretty much. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Monica! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey man, you feeling any better? ####<meld>neutral
Joey, we have something to tell you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Youre pregnant! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas. ####<meld>neutral
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God!Eh! Well ####<meld>surprise
You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn. ####<meld>disgust
Hes gonna go up to the counter with ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I missed this. ####<meld>joy
Me too. ####<meld>anger
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww! ####<meld>joy
Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help. ####<meld>anger
We will. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles. ####<meld>neutral
No Mon, ####<meld>neutral
Every year. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Ross! ####<meld>joy
Die Hard ####<meld>neutral
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature? ####<meld>neutral
Whatd you rent? ####<meld>neutral
Die Hard 2 ####<meld>neutral
Joey, this is ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its ####<meld>neutral
Joey, we ####<meld>neutral
And? ####<meld>neutral
And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Die Hard ####<meld>neutral
Dude, you didnt say ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans. ####<meld>neutral
Well, John McClane had plans! ####<meld>anger
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch. ####<meld>neutral
What are you talking about? Bitch. ####<meld>anger
I know you botched that operation on purpose. ####<meld>joy
I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. ####<meld>anger
I don't care if you    are my brother. ####<meld>disgust
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch! ####<meld>joy
Stop going through my stuff ! ####<meld>anger
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. ####<meld>anger
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea. ####<meld>fear
Please, what about you and Chandler? ####<meld>anger
That's different! I was drunk and stupid! ####<meld>anger
Well hello ! ####<meld>anger
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them? ####<meld>neutral
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey! ####<meld>anger
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna do it. ####<meld>joy
And I can't stop you. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? ####<meld>neutral
I'm smarter than ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up. ####<meld>joy
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man. ####<meld>neutral
Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there. ####<meld>joy
No. ####<meld>neutral
No, thank you. ####<meld>neutral
You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there. ####<meld>neutral
Id love an ice water. ####<meld>neutral
You got it. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, what are you doing? ####<meld>surprise
Just being friendly. ####<meld>anger
Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there. ####<meld>anger
Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther? ####<meld>neutral
Dont wink at me. And put on your apron. ####<meld>anger
Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons. ####<meld>sadness
Joey, do you work here? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, waiter. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. ####<meld>neutral
Im calling for Monica Geller. ####<meld>neutral
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available ####<meld>neutral
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!! ####<meld>surprise
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever! ####<meld>anger
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am ####<meld>neutral
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again. ####<meld>sadness
So go fix it! ####<meld>neutral
Go find Chandler! ####<meld>neutral
He's probably up in your room! ####<meld>sadness
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him. ####<meld>anger
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one! ####<meld>joy
Anybody lose this? ####<meld>neutral
Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! ####<meld>joy
Hmm. ####<meld>neutral
Do you remember where the duck food is? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why? ####<meld>surprise
Because Im going to London. ####<meld>neutral
What?! What do you mean youre going to London? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. ####<meld>neutral
Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back. ####<meld>neutral
IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily! ####<meld>fear
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. ####<meld>fear
But I have to tell him how I feel! ####<meld>sadness
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision. ####<meld>neutral
Thats not why youre going! ####<meld>sadness
Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. ####<meld>sadness
Forget that British chippy." ####<meld>sadness
OhhDo you think he will?! ####<meld>surprise
No! ####<meld>sadness
Because hes in love with the British chippy! ####<meld>sadness
Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! ####<meld>anger
Yknow, its too late! ####<meld>anger
You missed youre chance! ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over. ####<meld>sadness
Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do." ####<meld>anger
I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter. ####<meld>joy
So is everybody here? ####<meld>neutral
I got here a little early myself. ####<meld>neutral
Let us begin. ####<meld>neutral
Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. ####<meld>neutral
Here. ####<meld>neutral
Here. ####<meld>neutral
Now as for the hydrosaurs ####<meld>neutral
Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. ####<meld>neutral
Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
So, do you think you can forgive me? ####<meld>sadness
Great. ####<meld>joy
Thanks. ####<meld>joy
Okay, bye. ####<meld>neutral
Hello, Jennifer? ####<meld>neutral
Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, shes not home huh? ####<meld>surprise
Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Are you all right? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh… I think I just got engaged. ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! He did it? ####<meld>surprise
Well…did you know he was gonna ask me? ####<meld>joy
Are you kidding? ####<meld>surprise
I’m like the one who talked him into it. ####<meld>joy
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group. ####<meld>sadness
And you really think this is a good idea? ####<meld>sadness
I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people. ####<meld>neutral
I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right. ####<meld>sadness
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so. ####<meld>surprise
Really?! Even Ross? ####<meld>surprise
Especially Ross! ####<meld>joy
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back. ####<meld>surprise
There he goes, your fiancée. ####<meld>joy
I guess so. ####<meld>neutral
Although he does play with himself in his sleep. ####<meld>neutral
I can’t say that I’m surprised. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that is so unfortunate. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>neutral
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight. ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone. ####<meld>neutral
You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out. ####<meld>joy
Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore. ####<meld>neutral
I think on some levels she already knows. ####<meld>neutral
Night Mon. Night Julio. ####<meld>neutral
Adiós. ####<meld>neutral
Look Julio, someone left their book here. ####<meld>surprise
Ah actually, that is mine. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, what are you reading? ####<meld>neutral
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it? ####<meld>neutral
Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it? ####<meld>neutral
I thought I would, but the translation's no good. ####<meld>neutral
Your a poet and don't know it. ####<meld>neutral
Actually I ah, I am a poet. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about? ####<meld>neutral
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip. ####<meld>neutral
Mine?  Right here? ####<meld>neutral
I can write an epic poem about this lip. ####<meld>joy
How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. ####<meld>joy
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Are we really in Montreal?! ####<meld>surprise
Yes we are. So, coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, heres batch 22. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers. ####<meld>anger
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg. ####<meld>neutral
Lets give it a shot. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale? ####<meld>surprise
No, just a Friday night. ####<meld>neutral
Would she? ####<meld>neutral
Would she?  You ate my candy bar! ####<meld>anger
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it. ####<meld>disgust
I know honey, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in. ####<meld>sadness
Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy! ####<meld>joy
Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt.... ####<meld>sadness
I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom. ####<meld>disgust
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you? ####<meld>anger
Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... ####<meld>fear
Its not funny, this is actually my job. ####<meld>anger
Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here. ####<meld>joy
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger. ####<meld>joy
Ah, just one other thing. ####<meld>neutral
Yes?! ####<meld>joy
I ah, I work at ####<meld>neutral
Do you want my pickle? ####<meld>neutral
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news? ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>surprise
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. ####<meld>neutral
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma. ####<meld>joy
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool. ####<meld>anger
We should do something. Whistle. ####<meld>joy
We are not going to whistle. ####<meld>anger
Come on, do it. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Do it! ####<meld>joy
No! ####<meld>anger
Do it do it do it! ####<meld>joy
Woo-woo! ####<meld>joy
I can't believe you did that! ####<meld>surprise
Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros. ####<meld>neutral
Still? ####<meld>surprise
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance. ####<meld>neutral
I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again. ####<meld>joy
Either eat it, or be in it. ####<meld>anger
Spoon?  So, what do you think? ####<meld>joy
Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. ####<meld>disgust
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in. ####<meld>joy
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? ####<meld>neutral
I can. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, go ahead. ####<meld>neutral
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon. ####<meld>neutral
Thats very good, whats your name? ####<meld>neutral
Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, you go to the head of the class. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>joy
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen. ####<meld>neutral
But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen. ####<meld>neutral
Human spleeeen. ####<meld>neutral
Olé! ####<meld>joy
What are you doing here! ####<meld>surprise
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain! ####<meld>joy
Great! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home". ####<meld>joy
Listen Phoebe... ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but... ####<meld>neutral
But what? ####<meld>neutral
This is kind of a classy place. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, say no more. ####<meld>neutral
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything. ####<meld>sadness
Well, I've brought some books. We could read. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet. ####<meld>joy
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do! ####<meld>joy
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention? ####<meld>neutral
We can't. We're not pharmacists! ####<meld>sadness
I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba... ####<meld>neutral
Kate Miller? ####<meld>neutral
Kate Miller it is. ####<meld>neutral
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend. ####<meld>joy
In that case should I make sure it's on real good? ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
This year was supposed to be great! ####<meld>anger
But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit! ####<meld>disgust
No. No, you're not a loser. ####<meld>sadness
Look at me! ####<meld>anger
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy! ####<meld>joy
Oh, be-because of the leather pants. ####<meld>sadness
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something. ####<meld>joy
That really is something.. that's really cool. ####<meld>joy
Howdy partner! ####<meld>joy
Maybe I should get another pair! ####<meld>joy
Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. ####<meld>joy
I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. ####<meld>joy
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. ####<meld>joy
I would make a good cowboy. ####<meld>joy
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep. ####<meld>neutral
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah! ####<meld>surprise
Great nap. ####<meld>neutral
It really was. ####<meld>neutral
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. ####<meld>joy
So, lets talk about women. Im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?" ####<meld>neutral
Oh, please! ####<meld>disgust
Hey, how you doin? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Mikey ####<meld>neutral
Hey P ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Setting rattraps ####<meld>neutral
To kill Bob?? ####<meld>surprise
No, no, to test his neck strength. ####<meld>neutral
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! ####<meld>anger
I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl. ####<meld>sadness
Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps. ####<meld>neutral
I'll find Bob, I'll get him. ####<meld>neutral
Bob? ####<meld>fear
Bob! ####<meld>sadness
Robert! ####<meld>anger
Oh wait, I think I hear him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh - Oh my god! ####<meld>surprise
Bob    had babies! ####<meld>surprise
Bob's a mom! ####<meld>surprise
Better think of a new name for him. ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl. ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ... ####<meld>neutral
Oh my god, we killed Bob! ####<meld>sadness
Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse. ####<meld>neutral
Suzie ####<meld>neutral
Hmmm, soup! ####<meld>joy
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, no problem. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. ####<meld>sadness
Joey! ####<meld>surprise
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! ####<meld>anger
So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. ####<meld>anger
I said, "No!" ####<meld>anger
Which puts ####<meld>neutral
Great. So the ball is in his court? ####<meld>anger
Ball? There is no ball. ####<meld>anger
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Why?! ####<meld>surprise
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and ####<meld>neutral
Oh great! That ####<meld>anger
Do-do you, do you have brothers? ####<meld>neutral
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy. ####<meld>neutral
Are you close with them? ####<meld>neutral
No-no, they're not very nice people. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, listen, I really like you. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
I think this can go somewhere. ####<meld>neutral
So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us? ####<meld>neutral
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of ####<meld>neutral
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold! ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Its over. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, was it awful? ####<meld>sadness
Well, it was loong. ####<meld>sadness
I didnt even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, she didnt want to stay. ####<meld>sadness
I called a cab. she just left. ####<meld>neutral
I wrote you a letter. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. ####<meld>joy
Its just some things Ive been thinking about. ####<meld>neutral
Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Wow, its-its 5:30 in the morning.  So, Id better get cracking on this baby. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Ill be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting. ####<meld>joy
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants! ####<meld>anger
Well, you said that we except the ####<meld>neutral
All right, that Ill retract. ####<meld>neutral
But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it. ####<meld>disgust
Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! ####<meld>disgust
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery. ####<meld>disgust
Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious. ####<meld>anger
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from? ####<meld>surprise
Lebanon. ####<meld>neutral
Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them. ####<meld>anger
How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, then what happened? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn! ####<meld>anger
Hey Pheebs, what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing!   This is not over! ####<meld>anger
No! No! No! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks! ####<meld>sadness
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies? ####<meld>neutral
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it. ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now. ####<meld>sadness
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff. ####<meld>neutral
That's okay, Joe. ####<meld>neutral
All right, let's go Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Oh God! ####<meld>surprise
That was amazing. ####<meld>joy
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? ####<meld>joy
We may have just started a family. ####<meld>joy
Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby. ####<meld>joy
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket. ####<meld>neutral
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye! ####<meld>anger
I knew it! ####<meld>surprise
I knew it! ####<meld>anger
I always knew she liked him! ####<meld>anger
Y'know, shed say no, but here we are! ####<meld>anger
Right? ####<meld>neutral
We just broke up, first thing she does! ####<meld>anger
You didnt just break up. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, its been like three weeks! ####<meld>anger
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower! ####<meld>disgust
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. ####<meld>joy
Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes. ####<meld>neutral
I made a promise that--Oh hey! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
You're nose is bleeding! ####<meld>surprise
Oh God. ####<meld>sadness
No! ####<meld>sadness
Oh not again! ####<meld>anger
This-this happened when my grandfather died. ####<meld>sadness
It's ugh! ####<meld>disgust
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me? ####<meld>neutral
Umm ####<meld>neutral
Sorry. Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either. ####<meld>neutral
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! ####<meld>fear
Hello, Chip. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Rach! How ya doin? ####<meld>joy
Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at ####<meld>joy
So ah, Monica ready yet? ####<meld>neutral
Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch? ####<meld>neutral
Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready? ####<meld>surprise
Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time. ####<meld>joy
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that? ####<meld>surprise
Hes talking to the baby. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! ####<meld>surprise
Okay! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick." ####<meld>surprise
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my, oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Aw, its unbelievable! ####<meld>surprise
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
She is kicking so much! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, shes like ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player? ####<meld>joy
Mia Hamm? ####<meld>neutral
Mia Hamm! ####<meld>joy
Oh thats amazing. ####<meld>joy
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe! ####<meld>surprise
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, what do you guys think? ####<meld>neutral
Dude! ####<meld>surprise
I have never known love like this. ####<meld>sadness
You really like it? ####<meld>surprise
Dude! How-how did you write this? ####<meld>surprise
I stole Monicas and changed the name. ####<meld>neutral
You cant ####<meld>neutral
If he goes first he can! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>anger
Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow thats a great idea! And ####<meld>joy
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. ####<meld>joy
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset. ####<meld>neutral
All the time? ####<meld>sadness
All the time! ####<meld>anger
Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog. ####<meld>neutral
Im all done. ####<meld>neutral
Thank God. ####<meld>joy
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together. ####<meld>neutral
Oh right. ####<meld>neutral
Right. ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried? ####<meld>joy
Were probably too old to do that now. ####<meld>sadness
Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles. ####<meld>joy
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related. ####<meld>joy
It took you that long to figure it out, huh? ####<meld>surprise
Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be. ####<meld>neutral
Relax every muscle in your body. ####<meld>neutral
Listen to the plinky-plunky music. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, tell me your happy place. ####<meld>neutral
Richard's living room, drinking wine. ####<meld>joy
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out! ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place. ####<meld>sadness
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything. ####<meld>neutral
All right, I'll try not to. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky.... ####<meld>neutral
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake? ####<meld>sadness
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees.... ####<meld>joy
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine. ####<meld>sadness
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. ####<meld>joy
And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook.... ####<meld>neutral
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee. ####<meld>disgust
OK sweetie, I'll see you later. ####<meld>neutral
See you later Rach. ####<meld>neutral
Bye-bye Julie. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, c'mon, cut it out. ####<meld>joy
Hey? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Can I ask you somethin'? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower. ####<meld>joy
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute? ####<meld>neutral
What's up? ####<meld>neutral
F.Y.I.. ####<meld>neutral
I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. ####<meld>neutral
Her name is Stephanie... something. ####<meld>neutral
She's supposed to be very good. ####<meld>neutral
But what about Phoebe? ####<meld>surprise
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around. ####<meld>disgust
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her. ####<meld>sadness
Uh... ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her? ####<meld>fear
Ahh, no. ####<meld>sadness
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Are you jealous? ####<meld>surprise
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. ####<meld>anger
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? ####<meld>anger
You are totally jealous. ####<meld>joy
I'm not jealous. ####<meld>anger
All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. ####<meld>neutral
And y'know, and um, I... ####<meld>neutral
Honey, I love you too. ####<meld>neutral
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
Huh. ####<meld>surprise
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know. ####<meld>joy
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper. ####<meld>neutral
I cant believe you came back. ####<meld>surprise
Dont say anything. ####<meld>joy
I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think. ####<meld>neutral
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now. ####<meld>joy
Rachel! Rachel! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>neutral
You missed the exit! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, sorry. ####<meld>neutral
My God, what were you thinking about? ####<meld>surprise
Um,  Barry. ####<meld>neutral
Awwwww ####<meld>joy
I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love! ####<meld>surprise
Dude! ####<meld>joy
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing. ####<meld>joy
God! ####<meld>surprise
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows! ####<meld>joy
Well actually, Ross doesn't. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet. ####<meld>neutral
Dear Mary-Angela. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
How?s it going. ####<meld>neutral
This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write. ####<meld>sadness
What the hell?s a matter with you? ####<meld>disgust
How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter? ####<meld>anger
Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba. ####<meld>neutral
All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. ####<meld>neutral
At least you know her name. ####<meld>neutral
You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy. ####<meld>neutral
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela? ####<meld>fear
Where in Cuba? ####<meld>sadness
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
You uh, you may have been right about Jill. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! I knew it! What happened? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, she kissed me. ####<meld>sadness
What?! You kissed! ####<meld>surprise
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have? ####<meld>neutral
A two and a five. ####<meld>neutral
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars! ####<meld>joy
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got? ####<meld>neutral
A four and a nine. ####<meld>neutral
Youre kidding right? ####<meld>surprise
No. Why? ####<meld>neutral
Well thats a full cup! ####<meld>surprise
Damn! I am good at Cups! ####<meld>joy
What? Why? Where are you? ####<meld>surprise
Im still on the set! ####<meld>neutral
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour! ####<meld>anger
I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister. ####<meld>sadness
No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now. ####<meld>anger
Ugh! Joey, I have to go. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power! ####<meld>anger
Oh hey Joey! What's up? ####<meld>joy
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I've been around. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route? ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. ####<meld>neutral
Great! Problem solved! ####<meld>joy
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance. ####<meld>sadness
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control. ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town. ####<meld>sadness
Bastard! ####<meld>anger
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh! ####<meld>surprise
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp! ####<meld>surprise
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I can't believe it! ####<meld>surprise
I mean I think it's great! ####<meld>joy
For him. ####<meld>neutral
She might be able to do better. ####<meld>neutral
Hey guys! ####<meld>neutral
Joey! Come here! Come here! ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
You mean how they're friends and nothing more? ####<meld>neutral
No. Joey, she ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows? ####<meld>surprise
Yes, but y'know what? ####<meld>neutral
It doesn't matter who knows what. ####<meld>neutral
Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! ####<meld>neutral
Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over! ####<meld>joy
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things. ####<meld>neutral
You really think it would be that different? ####<meld>surprise
How could it not be? ####<meld>surprise
I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. ####<meld>sadness
And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a ####<meld>sadness
Well, things change. ####<meld>neutral
I dont want them to move to a ####<meld>sadness
Itll be okay Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Its still there! ####<meld>surprise
Mrs. Braverman must be out. ####<meld>neutral
She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months. ####<meld>sadness
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake. ####<meld>fear
No that could kill her. ####<meld>fear
Well, we dont want that. ####<meld>neutral
No, so were protecting her. ####<meld>neutral
But we should take it. ####<meld>neutral
But we should move quick. ####<meld>fear
Why? ####<meld>surprise
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there. ####<meld>fear
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! ####<meld>fear
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. ####<meld>neutral
Well, you're gonna. ####<meld>neutral
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls... ####<meld>neutral
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. ####<meld>neutral
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? ####<meld>sadness
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking... ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you're not him. ####<meld>neutral
You're you. ####<meld>neutral
When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. ####<meld>neutral
Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! ####<meld>neutral
And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married." ####<meld>neutral
You really think so? ####<meld>joy
Yeah. I really do. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks, Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Get off! ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese? ####<meld>neutral
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack? ####<meld>neutral
And the cream? ####<meld>neutral
Cheese makes me thirsty. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Lets move on. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before? ####<meld>surprise
Oh no! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know anything about cooking. ####<meld>neutral
I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles. ####<meld>neutral
Well, hats off to the chef. ####<meld>joy
I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now? ####<meld>neutral
The chef! ####<meld>joy
Thats right. ####<meld>joy
Hey, Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
How's it going? ####<meld>neutral
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys. ####<meld>joy
So what's going on? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. ####<meld>neutral
I dunno, there's just something about... ####<meld>neutral
Basically we just feel that he's... ####<meld>neutral
We hate that guy. ####<meld>disgust
Yeah. Hate him. ####<meld>disgust
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out? ####<meld>neutral
...No, we hate him. ####<meld>disgust
We're sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt. ####<meld>neutral
Yes that was mine. ####<meld>fear
Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there. ####<meld>neutral
Yes that would have made more sense. ####<meld>sadness
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! ####<meld>anger
All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. ####<meld>neutral
And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. ####<meld>neutral
Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise? ####<meld>anger
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day? ####<meld>anger
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball. ####<meld>neutral
She said what? ####<meld>surprise
She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it." ####<meld>neutral
Postpone it? ####<meld>joy
Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? ####<meld>anger
Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? ####<meld>anger
This isnt right. ####<meld>neutral
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right. ####<meld>sadness
I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? ####<meld>anger
Dont you point your pants at me! ####<meld>anger
We have no choice! ####<meld>anger
Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand? ####<meld>anger
This is our wedding Im talking about. ####<meld>anger
The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married. ####<meld>neutral
So what are you saying? Its now or never? ####<meld>anger
No. Im saying its now. ####<meld>neutral
Or? ####<meld>anger
Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!! ####<meld>anger
Its not the pants. ####<meld>anger
Its you that is backwards. ####<meld>anger
And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all! ####<meld>anger
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please ####<meld>sadness
Hi, honey. ####<meld>neutral
See you later. ####<meld>neutral
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner! ####<meld>joy
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! ####<meld>anger
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no! ####<meld>surprise
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available ####<meld>neutral
Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!! ####<meld>fear
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! ####<meld>surprise
NOOOO!!!!!!!! ####<meld>anger
Ma! What're you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
I came to give you this  and this. ####<meld>neutral
Oww! Big ring! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. ####<meld>neutral
Do you uh, do you talk about me? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, all the time. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy. ####<meld>neutral
Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge! ####<meld>disgust
Have you ever seen so much crap? ####<meld>disgust
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap ####<meld>anger
Check this out. Can I have this? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. ####<meld>neutral
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. ####<meld>neutral
It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. ####<meld>joy
If it's not you, this is a horrible story. ####<meld>sadness
Fortunately, it is me. ####<meld>joy
And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. ####<meld>joy
Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. ####<meld>joy
Y'know, someplace nice. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, someplace nice. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
How much do you think I can get for my kidney? ####<meld>neutral
So, what do you think? ####<meld>neutral
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen. ####<meld>joy
I know! ####<meld>joy
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads? ####<meld>neutral
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play! ####<meld>joy
Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck! ####<meld>joy
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable. ####<meld>neutral
Gotcha. ####<meld>neutral
This place is really my Grandmothers. ####<meld>neutral
I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. ####<meld>neutral
So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR. ####<meld>neutral
So are you thirsty? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you bet I am! ####<meld>joy
Okay, heres your penis! ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, okay. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house. ####<meld>joy
Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, ready for dinner? ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right? ####<meld>joy
Ooh, I love that place!  So, no. ####<meld>neutral
How about Mama Lisettie's? ####<meld>neutral
Enh. Sure! ####<meld>neutral
I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out. ####<meld>disgust
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! ####<meld>neutral
Thatthis milk is mine. ####<meld>neutral
I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, let's go! ####<meld>joy
Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the ####<meld>anger
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?! ####<meld>disgust
Okay, stop! ####<meld>anger
Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? ####<meld>neutral
Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever? ####<meld>anger
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. ####<meld>joy
Go! ####<meld>neutral
Go! ####<meld>anger
Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose. ####<meld>disgust
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here! ####<meld>sadness
No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink! ####<meld>joy
I know. Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
All right fine! This looks like so much fun. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
God, what a mess. ####<meld>neutral
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I lost. ####<meld>sadness
Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. ####<meld>sadness
Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes. ####<meld>anger
Hey! Howd the interview go? ####<meld>joy
Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. ####<meld>sadness
Thats not how that was supposed to come out. ####<meld>sadness
This is the worst Christmas ever. ####<meld>sadness
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house. ####<meld>neutral
I cant! ####<meld>anger
Its too late! ####<meld>anger
Terry already hired that girl over there. ####<meld>sadness
Look at her, shes even got waitress experience. ####<meld>sadness
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans. ####<meld>sadness
That word was swans. ####<meld>neutral
What do we got there? ####<meld>surprise
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief! ####<meld>surprise
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened. ####<meld>joy
It's all right. ####<meld>neutral
It's all right. ####<meld>neutral
You don't have to explain. ####<meld>neutral
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control. ####<meld>neutral
You're our third call tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year. ####<meld>neutral
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down. ####<meld>sadness
No, you were right. I don't have a plan. ####<meld>neutral
Thank God. Food. ####<meld>joy
Phoebe? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Do you have a plan? ####<meld>neutral
I don't even have a 'pl'. ####<meld>joy
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. ####<meld>sadness
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?' ####<meld>surprise
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks? ####<meld>surprise
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? ####<meld>joy
And-and a power tie? ####<meld>joy
Oh God. ####<meld>surprise
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! ####<meld>surprise
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? ####<meld>neutral
Big Bird's friend. ####<meld>neutral

Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the ####<meld>neutral

Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early ####<meld>joy
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor. ####<meld>joy
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to ####<meld>joy

Doogie, shh! ####<meld>anger

Ah, Susan will be so pleased. ####<meld>joy
717?  Wheres 717?  Hey, youve have more of these for Susan right? ####<meld>surprise
No. But its okay, Ill just put out pickles or something. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, thank God. ####<meld>joy
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering? ####<meld>surprise
I ate a bug. ####<meld>disgust
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up. ####<meld>joy
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck. ####<meld>fear
Oh, now you want a favour? ####<meld>joy
Yes, please. ####<meld>neutral
Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay? ####<meld>anger
Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends. ####<meld>neutral
No, Im not gonna pick them up. ####<meld>anger
Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk. ####<meld>neutral
So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car. ####<meld>anger
No, Rachel doesnt want me to.... ####<meld>anger
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, youre right. ####<meld>neutral
God, I feel so guilty about Ross. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, I know. ####<meld>sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault. ####<meld>sadness
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened. ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! ####<meld>anger
Well, I think it's very brave what you said. ####<meld>anger
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. ####<meld>neutral
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing? ####<meld>anger
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. ####<meld>anger
Okay, I admit it! ####<meld>anger
I love this coat! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! ####<meld>joy
Remember Phil Huntley? ####<meld>neutral
He was fine! ####<meld>joy
So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man! ####<meld>joy
Oh no ####<meld>fear
Id better go. (She goes and sits down in the ####<meld>neutral
Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail. ####<meld>sadness
I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now shes totally freaked out! ####<meld>anger
Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address? ####<meld>neutral
Rachel! ####<meld>anger
All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear. Ill-Ill-Ill-Ill talk to her. ####<meld>fear
Okay! ####<meld>anger

"We were on a break!" ####<meld>anger
"No we werent!" ####<meld>anger
What happened to you two? ####<meld>surprise
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry. ####<meld>neutral
But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. ####<meld>neutral
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes. ####<meld>neutral
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the ####<meld>surprise
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir. ####<meld>neutral
Is this because of the burrito thing? ####<meld>sadness
You need to give him money. ####<meld>neutral
Give him money? It was a joke! ####<meld>surprise
No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off. ####<meld>anger
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money. ####<meld>neutral
You've got to be smooth about it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, I can be smooth. ####<meld>neutral
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. ####<meld>neutral
Of course, sir. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Id better get back to my desk. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation. ####<meld>joy
My what? ####<meld>surprise
Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. ####<meld>neutral
But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. ####<meld>neutral
Are you serious? ####<meld>surprise
No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up? ####<meld>neutral
I can blow dry it. ####<meld>neutral
I can put gel on it. ####<meld>neutral
It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. ####<meld>neutral
Its so annoying. ####<meld>disgust
Does it bug you? ####<meld>sadness
You bug me. ####<meld>disgust
Is there any chance you didnt see that? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Joey, what cha doing? ####<meld>neutral
Sweepin. Why? Turn you on? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney? ####<meld>joy

Joey,  where did you learn that word? ####<meld>surprise
Where do you think,  Zelda? ####<meld>neutral
You found my book?! ####<meld>anger
Yeah I did! ####<meld>joy
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?! ####<meld>anger
Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn! ####<meld>surprise
Hey-hey, yknow what? ####<meld>anger
Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica. ####<meld>neutral
Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. ####<meld>anger
You got porn! ####<meld>joy
Well, I feel like a snack! ####<meld>joy
Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no thanks. I dont like ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. ####<meld>sadness
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots. ####<meld>neutral
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!! ####<meld>anger
How did you know about that?! ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Come in. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and ####<meld>neutral
Great! ####<meld>joy
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, so I made up a little test. ####<meld>neutral
Now, Im gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind. ####<meld>neutral
I can do that. ####<meld>neutral

Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the- ####<meld>disgust

Will you hurry up? ####<meld>sadness
Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?! ####<meld>surprise
And that theyre going to be drinking alot! ####<meld>anger
No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic. ####<meld>neutral
Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster? ####<meld>anger
Joey! ####<meld>anger
Come on! ####<meld>anger
I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright? ####<meld>anger
This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle? ####<meld>fear
So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright? ####<meld>neutral
Oh I am! ####<meld>joy
Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will! ####<meld>anger
Okay, fine! ####<meld>anger
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay. ####<meld>neutral
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute? ####<meld>joy
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny. ####<meld>joy
Okay, now you're even cuter!! ####<meld>joy
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me. ####<meld>surprise
What are you talking about? ####<meld>surprise
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy. ####<meld>joy
That's not possible! ####<meld>joy
Ow! ####<meld>surprise
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way. ####<meld>joy
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough. ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her. ####<meld>sadness
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud! ####<meld>anger
This bicep? ####<meld>surprise
Well it's not flexed right now! ####<meld>anger
It's Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in? ####<meld>sadness
Umm, well, umm Grandma died. ####<meld>sadness

Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not? ####<meld>anger
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. ####<meld>disgust
anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three years. ####<meld>neutral
He was my first client when I became a party planner. ####<meld>neutral
He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well. ####<meld>neutral
And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Oh, thats great! ####<meld>joy
Really? Like how? ####<meld>surprise
Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a good one. ####<meld>joy
Yeah? You like that one? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, youre funny. ####<meld>joy
Im funny? ####<meld>surprise
Oh thank God! ####<meld>joy
Well hey, Ive got a ton of these! ####<meld>joy
Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. ####<meld>neutral
Right? ####<meld>neutral
And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. ####<meld>neutral
And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face. ####<meld>neutral
Can I do it to you? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay? ####<meld>joy
Chloe? Hi.. ####<meld>neutral
Is this about me taking your watch? ####<meld>sadness
You took my watch? ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry, I do that. ####<meld>sadness
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us? ####<meld>sadness
Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. That-that was the problem. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!! ####<meld>joy

Is that all? ####<meld>neutral
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, how is he? ####<meld>surprise
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie. ####<meld>neutral
Isnt he an architect now? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, they still wear underwear. ####<meld>neutral
So the Porsche guy took his car back. ####<meld>neutral
But you found the keys to his clothes? ####<meld>neutral
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche. ####<meld>joy
And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Oh! Its you.  Hi. ####<meld>surprise
What about me?! You-you just said I could! ####<meld>anger

Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down. ####<meld>sadness

It's a money thing, we don't have any. ####<meld>sadness
You're kidding right? ####<meld>surprise
No. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, hang out?! How long? ####<meld>sadness
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
A week? ####<meld>anger
Maybe two? ####<meld>neutral
The money will turn up! ####<meld>neutral
People will always wanna invest in movies! ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you're not rich are ya? ####<meld>neutral

Eh, worth a shot.  Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay? ####<meld>neutral
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
These got left for ya. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks.   Congratulations on your big break. ####<meld>sadness
Rachel, do you have any muffins left? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I forget which ones. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
So how was Joan? ####<meld>neutral
I broke up with her. ####<meld>neutral
Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing? ####<meld>surprise
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them. ####<meld>disgust
Come on, they were not that huge. ####<meld>neutral
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain. ####<meld>disgust
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things? ####<meld>surprise
Hold it, hold it. ####<meld>neutral
I gotta side with Chandler on this one. ####<meld>neutral
When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. ####<meld>disgust
It made me nuts. ####<meld>disgust
You or me? ####<meld>neutral
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples. ####<meld>neutral
You guys are messing with me, right? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa." ####<meld>joy
Oh my God, hes lost it. Hes totally lost it. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>surprise
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source. ####<meld>neutral
Youre a genius! ####<meld>joy
Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies! ####<meld>sadness
Now, theres two reasons. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him. ####<meld>neutral
Where?! ####<meld>surprise
On the touchy. ####<meld>neutral
And ####<meld>neutral
No, I know! ####<meld>surprise
I-Im sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one. ####<meld>anger
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I dont wanna get ####<meld>joy
Thank you, Joey. ####<meld>neutral
No-no, thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Estelle, listen ####<meld>neutral
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They ####<meld>surprise
What are you talkin about? I never left you! Youve always been my agent! ####<meld>surprise
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Oh well, no harm, no foul. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you guys free tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah!! ####<meld>joy
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime. ####<meld>surprise
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we werewe were just looking around. ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars. ####<meld>surprise
What exactly were you looking for, hmm? ####<meld>neutral
Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stocks musings on the Smiledon Californicus? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh. ####<meld>neutral
Ah AhGet out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marions views on evolution? ####<meld>anger
Uh, actually I find Marions views far too progressionist. ####<meld>neutral
I find Marions views far too progressionist. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry, who are you? ####<meld>surprise
Im a professor here uh, RossGeller. ####<meld>neutral
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Its uhWait!  Did you write this? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?! ####<meld>surprise
Yknow, you look nothing like I wouldve thought. Youreyoure so young. ####<meld>surprise
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade. ####<meld>neutral
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. ####<meld>anger
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? ####<meld>anger
The point is I... ####<meld>anger
I don't need this right now, OK. ####<meld>anger
It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. ####<meld>anger
This ship has sailed. ####<meld>anger
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. ####<meld>anger
Fine. ####<meld>anger
Cause I don't need your stupid ship. ####<meld>anger
Good. ####<meld>anger
Good. ####<meld>anger
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something. ####<meld>neutral
All in good time my love. ####<meld>neutral
All in good time. ####<meld>neutral
Oh shoot! ####<meld>surprise
I left my guitar in their apartment. ####<meld>sadness
Well you can let me in later. ####<meld>neutral
I dont have a key, they took mine to give to you. ####<meld>neutral
What?! They took mine to give to you! ####<meld>surprise
Why would they take away our keys? ####<meld>surprise
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff. ####<meld>joy
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all. ####<meld>joy
A ####<meld>neutral
No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, what? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. ####<meld>joy
WhatYoure not serious. ####<meld>surprise
I mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. ####<meld>anger
Shell drive us totally crazy. ####<meld>disgust
Hi Ross! ####<meld>joy
Hi roomie! ####<meld>joy
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know! ####<meld>neutral
Its not like its porn! ####<meld>neutral
This is a serious, legitimate movie. ####<meld>neutral
And the nudity is really important to the story. ####<meld>neutral
Thats what you say about porn. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back. ####<meld>neutral
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on! ####<meld>joy
Well thats true. ####<meld>neutral
And I am only naked in one scene. ####<meld>neutral
Plus it sounds really great. ####<meld>neutral
My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. ####<meld>neutral
Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. ####<meld>neutral
So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. ####<meld>neutral
Its really sweet and-and tender. ####<meld>joy
Hey, whats up? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight. ####<meld>sadness
But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. ####<meld>neutral
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice! ####<meld>joy
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me. ####<meld>neutral
And whats more different than me. A guy whos ####<meld>neutral
So where are we going next? ####<meld>neutral
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home. ####<meld>neutral
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we? ####<meld>fear
Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up? ####<meld>joy
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, no one talks like that! ####<meld>anger
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop! ####<meld>anger
Hey, I'm more cop than you two! ####<meld>anger
How do you figure that? ####<meld>neutral
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner! ####<meld>neutral
I guess so. ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. Thank you! ####<meld>neutral
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one? ####<meld>neutral
Oh what, you-you want both of them? ####<meld>surprise
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?! ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. ####<meld>fear
I know it's in the apartment, but I ####<meld>neutral
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight! ####<meld>fear
Tell her to wear her own earrings. ####<meld>anger
These ####<meld>neutral
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff! ####<meld>anger
Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Because I lose her stuff! ####<meld>anger
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>neutral
Whats going on? ####<meld>neutral
Chandlers gone again! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?! ####<meld>sadness
Okay. You ready to push again? ####<meld>neutral
I already had a baby. Leave me alone. ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it! ####<meld>joy
Yeah!! ####<meld>joy
Little Leslie is here! ####<meld>joy
We got another one! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. ####<meld>surprise
How scary is that? ####<meld>surprise
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on! ####<meld>joy
All right, he's coming. He's coming! ####<meld>joy
Hey, where's his thing? ####<meld>surprise
Chandler's a girl! ####<meld>surprise
Oh God, kindergarten flashback. ####<meld>surprise
They musta read the sonogram wrong. ####<meld>surprise
Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! ####<meld>surprise
Chandler's a girl! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, keep saying it! ####<meld>joy
Am I too late?! ####<meld>neutral
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes. ####<meld>joy
We have our babies? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>joy
Oh, we have our babies. ####<meld>joy
Hey Toby! ####<meld>joy
Hey Bobby. ####<meld>neutral
Its Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler ####<meld>neutral
Uhh yeah. Yeah, its  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why? ####<meld>neutral
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is. ####<meld>anger
Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here. ####<meld>sadness
Toby dont. ####<meld>sadness
Bob! ####<meld>sadness
Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler! ####<meld>anger
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute! ####<meld>joy
I know! I found it on the street. ####<meld>joy
Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Its moving. ####<meld>fear
Ew. ####<meld>disgust
Its stillIts got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!! ####<meld>fear
Ooh! Ah! Okay! ####<meld>fear
Well, I went over to Kyles last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing ####<meld>neutral
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So ####<meld>sadness
Oh just say it Kyle! ####<meld>surprise
Were gonna give it another try. ####<meld>joy
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?! ####<meld>anger
Im gonna work on that. ####<meld>neutral
Oh right, because youre so capable of change. ####<meld>anger
Yknow, he hums when he pees! ####<meld>anger
I do know. ####<meld>neutral
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever. ####<meld>disgust
Were so sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Im over it already. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, were gonna go. ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Yknow, she ####<meld>sadness
Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we're better off without them. ####<meld>anger
And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let him in your sad mens club! ####<meld>anger
Divorced mens club. ####<meld>sadness
Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche? ####<meld>anger
Maybe because youve got the keys? ####<meld>anger
This is totally your fault! ####<meld>anger
My fault?! You threatened the judge! ####<meld>anger
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Have you seen Chandler?! ####<meld>neutral
No! Why? ####<meld>neutral
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! ####<meld>fear
I know! ####<meld>fear
How bad is this? ####<meld>fear
Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God! ####<meld>fear
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him anywhere! ####<meld>fear
What are you gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure! ####<meld>anger
"Yknow, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?" ####<meld>neutral
Rachel said that! ####<meld>surprise
Well Rachels not here! ####<meld>anger
Come on, come on. ####<meld>neutral
Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. ####<meld>anger
This is all your fault. ####<meld>anger
This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? ####<meld>anger
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you. ####<meld>anger
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. ####<meld>anger
No no no, believe me. ####<meld>anger
No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? ####<meld>anger
And you know what the funny thing is? ####<meld>neutral
When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? ####<meld>anger
Where does that leave me? ####<meld>sadness
You get to be the baby's father. ####<meld>neutral
Everyone knows who you are. ####<meld>neutral
Who am I? ####<meld>anger
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day. ####<meld>sadness
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. ####<meld>neutral
This is so great. ####<meld>joy
You wanna explain that? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. ####<meld>sadness
And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. ####<meld>joy
And it's not even born yet. ####<meld>sadness
It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. ####<meld>joy
I'm sorry, you were fighting. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, how are you doing Kelly? ####<meld>neutral
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great! ####<meld>joy
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can ####<meld>neutral
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick! ####<meld>disgust
This is disgusting! ####<meld>disgust
I'm not reading this! ####<meld>disgust
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!! ####<meld>surprise
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. ####<meld>neutral
I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat... ####<meld>neutral
You know he's gay? ####<meld>neutral
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut? ####<meld>neutral
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. Hi. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
Well, what? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
What is it? ####<meld>neutral
That she left you? ####<meld>surprise
That she likes women? ####<meld>neutral
That she left you for another woman that likes women? ####<meld>neutral
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... ####<meld>anger
Then what? ####<meld>neutral
My first time with Carol was... ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
It was my ####<meld>neutral
With Carol?  Oh. ####<meld>surprise
So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh. ####<meld>surprise
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! ####<meld>surprise
Hi. Where is everybody? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong? ####<meld>sadness
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over. ####<meld>sadness
Oh no! Why? ####<meld>surprise
Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny. ####<meld>surprise
Im an idiot. ####<meld>disgust
I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out and shed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know look at her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool! ####<meld>sadness
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover? ####<meld>neutral
Well, now I do!! ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Seven years. ####<meld>sadness
I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever.... ####<meld>sadness
Aw, God Ross. Oh. ####<meld>sadness
Ill do it. ####<meld>neutral
No you wont. ####<meld>neutral
Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, hes sorry. ####<meld>sadness
But,  youve got one more apology to make, all right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, absolutely! ####<meld>joy
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Youve got it. ####<meld>neutral
Cookie, now you can punch him! ####<meld>anger
What?! ####<meld>surprise
All right, that's it, I quit. ####<meld>anger
What? I didn't say anything. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. ####<meld>anger
Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person. ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. ####<meld>sadness
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it. ####<meld>anger
Julie. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Jody! ####<meld>surprise
You were with Julie? ####<meld>neutral
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. ####<meld>neutral
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, right.  Sure! ####<meld>anger
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. ####<meld>sadness
Look, I'm sorry, all right. ####<meld>sadness
I never meant for you to find out! ####<meld>sadness
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. ####<meld>anger
That is not true! ####<meld>anger
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here? ####<meld>anger
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? ####<meld>anger
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to ####<meld>sadness
Yeah! ####<meld>surprise
I cant say. ####<meld>neutral
Why?! ####<meld>surprise
Why not? ####<meld>sadness
I cant say because hes famous. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God, who is it?! ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us. ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby. ####<meld>neutral
As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin? ####<meld>surprise
What?! Well he never said that to me! ####<meld>surprise
In ####<meld>neutral
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse. ####<meld>sadness
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories. ####<meld>joy
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new. ####<meld>neutral
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, let's not tell this story. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, come on! ####<meld>sadness
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head! ####<meld>joy
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, it's not like it sounds. ####<meld>neutral
It's ####<meld>neutral
Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! ####<meld>anger
Who was that? ####<meld>neutral
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress. ####<meld>sadness
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. ####<meld>sadness
Ten dollars an hour. ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Twelve dollars an hour. ####<meld>neutral
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around. ####<meld>neutral
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. ####<meld>anger
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour. ####<meld>anger
Done. ####<meld>joy
The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it! ####<meld>fear
Youve got to get out of here! Save yourself! ####<meld>fear
No! I wont leave you! ####<meld>fear
Dont worry about me, Im a robot! Im just a machine!! ####<meld>sadness
No youre not! Not to me! ####<meld>anger
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
I am ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, youre great! Okay, lets take it from ####<meld>joy
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too. ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah, youre solid. Yeah, youre just no me. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont want to be over rehearsed. ####<meld>neutral
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Ill do it without you! ####<meld>anger
I dont need you or anybody else! ####<meld>anger
Im gonna make it on my own! ####<meld>anger
Youll see!! ####<meld>anger
Youll ####<meld>neutral
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad. ####<meld>sadness
I didn't know Ross and you were so close. ####<meld>surprise
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him. ####<meld>sadness
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. ####<meld>neutral
And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently. ####<meld>neutral
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance. ####<meld>sadness
But you didn't! ####<meld>joy
I'm still alive!! ####<meld>joy
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. ####<meld>joy
It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day! ####<meld>joy
I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people! ####<meld>joy
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you! ####<meld>anger
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!! ####<meld>joy
Well do a quick check. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
So, eight days late huh? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
You must be a little uncomfortable. ####<meld>neutral
Eh, just a tad. ####<meld>neutral
Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. ####<meld>neutral
It still could last a little while longer. ####<meld>neutral
If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along. ####<meld>neutral
Do them!! ####<meld>anger
Actually, theyre things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective. ####<meld>neutral
Well, we are ready to try anything. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
What is wrong with Emma? ####<meld>sadness
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa. ####<meld>neutral
Anytime you're ready. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, ok, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, where am I talking to, here? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... ####<meld>neutral
Just aim for the bump. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. ####<meld>neutral
You know, I, you know, can't do this. ####<meld>fear
Uh, this is too weird. ####<meld>disgust
I feel stupid. ####<meld>sadness
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it. ####<meld>neutral
Hello, baby. Hello, hello. ####<meld>joy
Oh, hi. Its Mark. ####<meld>neutral
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay? ####<meld>fear
Okay, I do. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I really do. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, Im gonna get your coat and then Ill-Ill put you in a cab. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, youre not gonna come with me? ####<meld>sadness
Of course I am. I just have to make a call. ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God! ####<meld>surprise
What?! I wh-, whats wrong? ####<meld>fear
Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like this. ####<meld>disgust
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just... ####<meld>neutral
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak! ####<meld>fear
Oh, I cant watch this. ####<meld>fear
Check it out, hes winning!  Petes winning! ####<meld>surprise
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
No-o-o!! ####<meld>fear
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area. ####<meld>fear
Oh! Oh! ####<meld>disgust
Wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it? ####<meld>surprise
Well, this is ironic. ####<meld>surprise
Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant. ####<meld>neutral
Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!! ####<meld>anger
Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers? ####<meld>neutral
We could, or we can have sex in it. ####<meld>joy
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants! ####<meld>joy
I thought I was a complete idiot. ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Im with you. He even asked me if I thought youd go out with him. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Oh, I think Im gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say? ####<meld>disgust
I said no. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
What? II just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people. ####<meld>surprise
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant? ####<meld>anger
I didnt tell him. I didnt know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people. ####<meld>neutral
Good-good, dont tell him. Dont tell him. Just have him call me okay? ####<meld>fear
Rach look, I really dont think thats such a great ####<meld>sadness
Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more actors! Ill meet em all! ####<meld>joy
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuas gone so you and Emily are free to go. ####<meld>neutral
Thats okay. ####<meld>neutral
Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so ####<meld>neutral
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket! ####<meld>anger
You tell them to wait! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Wait! Wait! ####<meld>neutral
Emily. ####<meld>neutral
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily! ####<meld>anger
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman. ####<meld>sadness
Nevermind! ####<meld>anger
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in. ####<meld>neutral
Jen. ####<meld>neutral
Jen, I know this may sound a little But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or ####<meld>neutral
Sure! That would be nice. ####<meld>joy
Umm? ####<meld>neutral
Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call. ####<meld>joy
I will give you a call. ####<meld>neutral
I'll see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
I forgot my paper. ####<meld>neutral
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Ow! ####<meld>surprise
Arent you gonna go? ####<meld>neutral
No. Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms. ####<meld>neutral
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.  Well, if everybodys going. ####<meld>neutral
No, y'know what dont close it  cause the... keys...are in there. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!! ####<meld>fear
Whats going on? ####<meld>neutral
My lighters in there! ####<meld>fear
I promise. ####<meld>neutral
Although, dont feel like you cant visit. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here? ####<meld>neutral
No, no hes not. ####<meld>neutral
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband. ####<meld>surprise
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him. ####<meld>neutral
Itll kill him. I mean itll, itll just kill him. ####<meld>fear
Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe ####<meld>neutral
Hey, what are you doing here? ####<meld>neutral
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of ####<meld>neutral
Ah yeah, but now its Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home. ####<meld>neutral
Wheres Ben? ####<meld>neutral
Hes sleeping. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time? ####<meld>surprise
Umm, yeah, actually, Susans gonna be home any minute, its kinda an anniversary. ####<meld>joy
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January? ####<meld>surprise
Its not that kind of anniversary. ####<meld>neutral
Ah!  Oh. ####<meld>surprise
Sooo!! Anyway... ####<meld>neutral
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh, oh, Ill get Rainy Day Bear!! ####<meld>joy
Because hell know what to do?  Oh my God, youre a genius! ####<meld>joy
Oh God, oh God, its sowed on though. ####<meld>fear
Give it. Give it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Oh!! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today. ####<meld>sadness
Please. This is so your fault. ####<meld>anger
How, how is this my fault? ####<meld>surprise
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along. ####<meld>anger
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along. ####<meld>anger
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! ####<meld>anger
Get in here. ####<meld>anger
Come on. ####<meld>neutral
My god, you guys, I don't believe you. ####<meld>anger
There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. ####<meld>anger
So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, Susan. ####<meld>neutral
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this. ####<meld>anger
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic? ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?" ####<meld>surprise
I didnt do that! Who wouldve done that?! ####<meld>surprise
Son of a bitch! ####<meld>anger
Okay, maybe ask this guy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they? ####<meld>joy
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? The only problem is, Carls acting is ####<meld>neutral
The ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big ####<meld>neutral
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake? ####<meld>neutral
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! ####<meld>anger
Hey Monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in? ####<meld>neutral
Sure, I love this part! ####<meld>joy
Come on in. ####<meld>neutral
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment. ####<meld>joy
In the moment, yeah. ####<meld>neutral
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again? ####<meld>joy
Sure, New Years Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Me neither. ####<meld>neutral
3, 2, ####<meld>neutral
Joey, you dont have to count down every time we kiss. ####<meld>joy
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready. ####<meld>joy
Alright. Phoebe? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay. ####<meld>neutral
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever. ####<meld>neutral
See, there's always one guy.  "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." ####<meld>disgust
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent? ####<meld>neutral
Probably kill myself! ####<meld>sadness
..Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! ####<meld>sadness
Joey, uh- ####<meld>surprise
You ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Joey, onstage! ####<meld>anger
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? ####<meld>sadness
I mean, Ill go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye. ####<meld>sadness
Where are you Vic? ####<meld>neutral
Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go. ####<meld>sadness
Vic! Vic! ####<meld>anger
In a minute!! ####<meld>anger
So this is it? Victor? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I guess it is. ####<meld>sadness
Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me. ####<meld>sadness
One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. ####<meld>sadness
But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I. ####<meld>sadness
And so Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. ####<meld>sadness
But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. ####<meld>sadness
But I wont have aged at all. ####<meld>neutral
So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her. ####<meld>neutral
So long, Vic! ####<meld>sadness
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is ####<meld>neutral
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on ####<meld>neutral
What song was that, Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
Hi Monica! ####<meld>joy
Hey Mon! ####<meld>joy
Hey Mon! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God, has she slept at all? ####<meld>surprise
Nope. ####<meld>neutral
No, it's been three nights in a row. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, okay that explains it. ####<meld>neutral
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. ####<meld>neutral
But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call. ####<meld>joy
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend. ####<meld>disgust
Yeah, I know but ####<meld>neutral
Oh no-no-no, Im there. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes? ####<meld>joy
You made pancakes? ####<meld>surprise
Yep! Grab a plate. ####<meld>joy
No-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, ####<meld>neutral
Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, hero sandwiches. ####<meld>neutral
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. ####<meld>neutral
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. ####<meld>neutral
Not you Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my good God. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs. ####<meld>neutral
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now. ####<meld>anger
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me. ####<meld>joy
Oh, the mixed tape. ####<meld>neutral
The Way You Look Tonight ####<meld>joy
You are just the sweetest. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey, guess what Im doing tonight. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Im checking out the restaurant with Pete. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you. ####<meld>joy
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find ####<meld>neutral
Ooh, actually Ive been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this! ####<meld>joy
Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someones been doing their homework. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I know.  Yknow, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda ####<meld>neutral
Oh, me too. ####<meld>neutral
and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar! ####<meld>joy
Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible. ####<meld>neutral
But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem? ####<meld>anger
It was really fun being married to you tonight. ####<meld>joy
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made. ####<meld>joy
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
That proposal, at the planetarium ####<meld>neutral
I know, I know it was stupid. ####<meld>sadness
Are you kidding?! ####<meld>surprise
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! ####<meld>joy
It wasreally wonderful! ####<meld>joy
Did you just make that up? ####<meld>surprise
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. ####<meld>neutral
Its how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. ####<meld>neutral
Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night ####<meld>neutral
Goodnight ####<meld>neutral
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up? ####<meld>neutral
I will think about it. ####<meld>neutral
Thats all Im askin ####<meld>neutral
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldnt feel bad! ####<meld>surprise
Well actually, I-I didnt eat mine. Its still in the bathroom. ####<meld>joy
No it isnt, I ate that. ####<meld>neutral
Well we left ours in Monicas bedroom. ####<meld>neutral
Nope, got it and I got yours  too. ####<meld>neutral
And thats Im so glad theres no problem. ####<meld>joy
Thats fine, actually Im on the hiring committee, so therell be at least one friendly face. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! Thats great! ####<meld>joy
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
No-ho-ho! ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, no-no-no-no-no, dont you worry, Im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy to get that job. ####<meld>neutral
Although, I might need some convincing. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I, umm ####<meld>fear
Kidding! God, I feel wild today! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Chandler just left though! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk. ####<meld>neutral
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry. ####<meld>neutral
I think it means he freaked out and left! ####<meld>surprise
Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do? ####<meld>sadness
LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! ####<meld>neutral
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay? ####<meld>neutral
I will, I will find him. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! Hey! ####<meld>joy
Do you guys know any cute guys? ####<meld>neutral
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. ####<meld>joy
Oh, Im sorry. Thank you Chandler. ####<meld>joy
Anyway, theres this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go ####<meld>neutral
Whats the charity? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot. ####<meld>neutral
Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Its weird. But the thing is need to find a date. ####<meld>surprise
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
What are you guys doing later? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut. ####<meld>neutral
We do? ####<meld>surprise
I want to see what he wants first. ####<meld>neutral
I just found out that Elizabeths dad wants to meet me. ####<meld>sadness
Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not Elizabeths dad?! ####<meld>surprise
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. ####<meld>fear
It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good. ####<meld>sadness
Of course well help! Yeah! Well be here! ####<meld>joy
Thanks! ####<meld>joy
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, hi! How are you doing? ####<meld>joy

Thanks for having me over, you guys. ####<meld>neutral

Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? ####<meld>neutral
Colorado. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, what good are you. ####<meld>neutral
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. ####<meld>sadness
Ityknow what? ####<meld>neutral
It just doesn't matter how I feel. ####<meld>sadness
I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? ####<meld>sadness
Um, I'm not. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out. ####<meld>sadness
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us. ####<meld>sadness
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. ####<meld>sadness
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal! ####<meld>anger
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. ####<meld>neutral

No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!  What?! ####<meld>anger
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid. ####<meld>anger
Your other student, was you! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder! ####<meld>anger
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! ####<meld>anger
Right here! ####<meld>anger
Here! ####<meld>anger
Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and ####<meld>neutral
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play ####<meld>anger

I think we do. Why dont we go inside?  Look uh, I know why youre here. ####<meld>sadness
You do? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. Thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends? ####<meld>sadness
Seriously. What?! ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? ####<meld>neutral
If you want to, we can do it one more time. ####<meld>neutral

In fact, I have some time right now. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, yknow what? Can I, can I talk now? ####<meld>joy

Im pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay, whenever youre ready.  And youre the father by the waybut you got that ####<meld>anger

Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go. ####<meld>surprise
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman. ####<meld>joy
Hmph. ####<meld>neutral
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. ####<meld>joy
And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place.... ####<meld>joy
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa! ####<meld>joy
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. ####<meld>anger
And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' ####<meld>anger
You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. ####<meld>anger
So it's kinda like, you're, you know. ####<meld>neutral
You know.... You don't know! ####<meld>surprise
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you? ####<meld>disgust
You said... ####<meld>neutral

I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel? ####<meld>neutral
Oh what are you kidding? Shes gorgeous, its all Rachel. ####<meld>joy
Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again? ####<meld>neutral
No, I know. ####<meld>neutral
I know, because youre not in that place. ####<meld>neutral
Which would be fine, except you totally are. ####<meld>neutral
Itsits complicated okay? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer. ####<meld>neutral
Look, weve been together. ####<meld>sadness
Okay? ####<meld>neutral
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. ####<meld>sadness
Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma. ####<meld>sadness
I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me. ####<meld>sadness
What do they put something in the water in this place? ####<meld>neutral
Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now. ####<meld>sadness
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, exactly. ####<meld>neutral
Right.  Or you might get everything youve wanted since you were fifteen. ####<meld>neutral
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have ####<meld>joy

Oh Ross youre so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax ####<meld>neutral
What-what are you doing?! Are youOkay thats not funny! Just stop horsing around! ####<meld>anger
I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around. ####<meld>joy
Uh-oh. ####<meld>fear
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble. ####<meld>neutral
Really? You think so? ####<meld>fear
I was talking to myself! Youre going down! ####<meld>anger
Hey honey! I missed you today! ####<meld>joy
Oh, yeah? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, well... Maybe we could... ####<meld>neutral
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? ####<meld>joy
Know your audience! ####<meld>joy
Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank. ####<meld>neutral
We really need to take those tests? ####<meld>sadness
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. ####<meld>neutral
I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests. ####<meld>neutral
But I don't wanna do it in a cup! ####<meld>sadness
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody? ####<meld>neutral
No. Have you seen David? ####<meld>neutral

Minsk? ####<meld>surprise
Minsk. It's in Russia. ####<meld>neutral
I know where Minsk is. ####<meld>neutral
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid. ####<meld>joy

Oo-oo! ####<meld>joy
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot. ####<meld>joy
Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our ####<meld>anger
Anyway, it wasnt the robot, it was the guy who controls him. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, he doesnt like me. ####<meld>anger
He had C.H.E.E.S.E. ####<meld>neutral
knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! ####<meld>anger
Ohh! ####<meld>surprise
Well, why dont you just get him fired? ####<meld>neutral
I may have to, I hate to do it, but Im the star! ####<meld>anger
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Theres a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me. ####<meld>neutral
Joey Tribbiani. ####<meld>neutral
Joe! Im glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya! ####<meld>joy
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
The thing is its kinda on the Q.T. ####<meld>neutral
The actor who has the part doesnt know he might be fired. ####<meld>neutral
Its the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. ####<meld>neutral
Im the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!! ####<meld>anger
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it! ####<meld>anger
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies? ####<meld>surprise
Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us. ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. ####<meld>neutral
Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it. ####<meld>neutral
Were good. ####<meld>neutral
Were really good. ####<meld>joy
Oh, did you catch him?! ####<meld>surprise
Wh-what did he say?! ####<meld>surprise
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda."  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name? ####<meld>neutral
Why?! Why not?! ####<meld>surprise
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! ####<meld>sadness
He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned! ####<meld>sadness
What did you say to him? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, sure. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, in about ten seconds youre gonna see him kiss me. ####<meld>joy
And in about five seconds youre gonna see why. ####<meld>neutral
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, get ready to see some beggin! ####<meld>joy
Oh, you came on to Ross! ####<meld>surprise
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Now Im so happy. ####<meld>joy
What are you talking about?! ####<meld>surprise
You used the Europe story! ####<meld>joy
Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex! ####<meld>anger
How do you know about that story?! ####<meld>surprise
How do ####<meld>neutral
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy! ####<meld>neutral
Some guy!! ####<meld>surprise
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams. ####<meld>neutral
Ken Adams!! ####<meld>surprise
How we doing, you guys ready? ####<meld>neutral
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature? ####<meld>neutral
Some days it's all I can think about. ####<meld>neutral
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings. ####<meld>neutral
Oh... ok, fine. ####<meld>neutral
But... ehm... ####<meld>neutral
I just have one question for you,    ehm... ####<meld>neutral
When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll... ####<meld>neutral
Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok,    let's go!! ####<meld>joy
I cant believe this! How long as this been going on? ####<meld>surprise
Well umm, Alexandra has been ####<meld>neutral
Oh, it has a name? ####<meld>surprise
Phoebe, dont get upset! ####<meld>sadness
OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go! ####<meld>anger
Well, Phoebe I thought IdYeah, what the hell. ####<meld>neutral
Ben! ####<meld>fear
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord. ####<meld>anger
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! ####<meld>fear
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts? ####<meld>neutral
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Sorry! ####<meld>sadness
I got my s's back! ####<meld>joy
Which we can celebrate later. ####<meld>neutral
Celebrate. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. ####<meld>joy
Rachel, how did this happen? ####<meld>neutral
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night. ####<meld>fear
Where? ####<meld>neutral
At his apartment. Is this juice? ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe? ####<meld>anger
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser. ####<meld>sadness
I licked my arm, what? ####<meld>surprise
It's breast milk. ####<meld>neutral
So? ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person. ####<meld>neutral
What is the big deal? ####<meld>anger
What did you just do? ####<meld>surprise
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk? ####<meld>disgust
You won't even taste it? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>disgust
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk? ####<meld>neutral
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. ####<meld>disgust
Aww! ####<meld>surprise
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet? ####<meld>disgust
Oh sure!  Noo! ####<meld>joy
Ohh!! ####<meld>surprise
My apothecary table!!! ####<meld>surprise
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Noooooo!! ####<meld>fear
Ross, where did you get this?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God, Phoebe, ####<meld>anger
Wow! Oh my God, well if theyve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars! ####<meld>anger
Well this doesnt even smell like opium. ####<meld>disgust
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way. ####<meld>anger
How is she? ####<meld>sadness
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign. ####<meld>neutral
How's the hair? ####<meld>neutral
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. ####<meld>sadness
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling. ####<meld>neutral
Can we see her? ####<meld>neutral
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in. ####<meld>sadness
How're you doing? ####<meld>sadness
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. ####<meld>joy
That would be no. ####<meld>disgust
Come on. It doesn't taste bad. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh... ####<meld>neutral
Cantaloupe juice. ####<meld>joy
Exactly. ####<meld>neutral
You've tasted it? You've tasted it. ####<meld>surprise
Uh huh. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you've tasted it. ####<meld>anger
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. ####<meld>neutral
Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel. ####<meld>anger
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number. ####<meld>anger
Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names. ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you. ####<meld>neutral
Regina Philange. ####<meld>neutral
I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong. ####<meld>surprise
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes. ####<meld>anger
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke! ####<meld>surprise
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! ####<meld>anger
Well maybe it was all of your questions. ####<meld>neutral
What about my questions? ####<meld>neutral
No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Ill get it. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me. ####<meld>surprise
Relax, its not like were forking. ####<meld>joy
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay. Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful. ####<meld>joy
I know!!! ####<meld>joy
So, Im here, ready to play. ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. ####<meld>joy
Whats this? ####<meld>surprise
Thats a dog, every house should have a dog. ####<meld>joy
Not one that can pee on the roof. ####<meld>surprise
Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste. ####<meld>joy
And is this in case the house sneezes? ####<meld>surprise
No, no, thats the ghost for the attic. ####<meld>neutral
I dont want a ghost. ####<meld>fear
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground. ####<meld>neutral
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hello. ####<meld>neutral
I need to talk to you! ####<meld>joy
Sure, whats up? ####<meld>neutral
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it. ####<meld>anger
Please, I'm not going for anything. ####<meld>disgust
Well, if you don't, I will. ####<meld>anger
Would you please go? ####<meld>joy
I would! ####<meld>anger
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?! ####<meld>joy
Uh-huh. ####<meld>neutral
Watch, watch. ####<meld>joy
Ooohhhh!! ####<meld>surprise
And, and! ####<meld>joy
Ahhhh!! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, my Fathers house does that! ####<meld>surprise
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything. ####<meld>neutral
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Its Emma. ####<meld>neutral
Emma!  See? I dont want it. ####<meld>sadness
Take it. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Its clearly an Emma. ####<meld>neutral
Oh honey, but you love that name. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, but I love you more. ####<meld>joy
Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing. ####<meld>neutral
So Im screwed. ####<meld>joy
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all the time! ####<meld>joy
Nice try. ####<meld>sadness
Wait, wait, wait! ####<meld>joy
Look, Monica ####<meld>neutral
Look! ####<meld>surprise
This is not going to work. ####<meld>anger
I bet this will work! ####<meld>joy
You are so great! I love you! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>surprise
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking! ####<meld>fear
You said you loved me! I can't believe this! ####<meld>surprise
No I didn't! ####<meld>fear
Yes, you did! ####<meld>surprise
No I didn't! ####<meld>fear
You love me! ####<meld>joy
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! ####<meld>anger
Hello Greg? ####<meld>neutral
Hi, this is Monica from the plane? ####<meld>neutral
Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5   That is their old number! ####<meld>anger
Jennys been giving it out since they moved! ####<meld>anger
Jenny! That is so Jenny! ####<meld>joy
Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? ####<meld>neutral
Say next Saturday? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, how about Sunday? ####<meld>neutral
Okay umm, the week after that? ####<meld>joy
The week after that? ####<meld>joy
Yknow what Greg? ####<meld>anger
We are good, interesting, funny people with ####<meld>anger
Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class. ####<meld>neutral
Whats a Movement class? ####<meld>neutral
Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime. ####<meld>neutral
Oh well listen, anyway shes directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition! ####<meld>joy
Oh, I dont know man. I havent talked to her in like ten years. ####<meld>neutral
I am. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, what are you talking about? Youre a terrific actor. ####<meld>neutral
You really think so? ####<meld>surprise
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?! ####<meld>surprise
Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the ####<meld>surprise
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! ####<meld>fear
This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does! ####<meld>surprise
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Ow! ####<meld>anger
Ooh! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now! ####<meld>fear
Oh, honey, dont worry. She's gonna make it on time. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey. ####<meld>neutral
But sadly I could not be enticed. ####<meld>joy
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?! ####<meld>disgust
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants. ####<meld>sadness
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. ####<meld>anger
Eh? ####<meld>neutral
All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. ####<meld>neutral
I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Well, what period is it from? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, its from yore. Like the days of yore. Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, yes I do. ####<meld>neutral
God, oh its just perfect! ####<meld>joy
I bet it has a great story behind it too. ####<meld>joy
Did they tell you anything? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains. ####<meld>joy
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place. ####<meld>joy
So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material? ####<meld>anger
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
I saw you checking me out during the game last night. ####<meld>neutral
I, umm, shut up! ####<meld>anger
Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. Ill miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this! ####<meld>sadness
Well, its pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right? ####<meld>neutral
Noooo!! ####<meld>sadness
All right, hang on! ####<meld>neutral
Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here. ####<meld>neutral
But I ####<meld>sadness
No-no, wait! ####<meld>neutral
Just let me finish, okay? ####<meld>sadness
This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. ####<meld>neutral
And it ####<meld>neutral
It is? Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, sweetie. ####<meld>neutral
I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore? ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>sadness
What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much! ####<meld>sadness
Im gonna miss you! ####<meld>sadness
I mean its the end of an era! ####<meld>sadness
I know! ####<meld>sadness
Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom? ####<meld>surprise
Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?! ####<meld>anger
Y'know what? ####<meld>neutral
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. ####<meld>neutral
Push! ####<meld>joy
Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. ####<meld>joy
Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! ####<meld>joy
Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. ####<meld>joy
Let's  I was justyeah, right. ####<meld>joy
Push! ####<meld>joy
Push! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, go left. Left! Left! ####<meld>surprise
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left! ####<meld>anger
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! ####<meld>anger
Straight up over your head! ####<meld>anger
You can do it! ####<meld>joy
You can do it! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
You got it? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, okay, I get it. ####<meld>neutral
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even ####<meld>fear
Howard's the ####<meld>neutral
Yes but too me he's just, man. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. ####<meld>anger
Ugh, can you believe that guy! ####<meld>disgust
Yeah. I really like his glasses. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>neutral
It kicked! I think the baby kicked! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here! ####<meld>fear
Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink! ####<meld>disgust
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time! ####<meld>anger
Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it. ####<meld>neutral
Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler. ####<meld>anger
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
You mind if I ####<meld>neutral
No, please. ####<meld>neutral
So uh, what are you in for? ####<meld>neutral
I talk in my sleep. ####<meld>neutral
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep. ####<meld>neutral
So why dont you give me your number? ####<meld>neutral
Previously on Friends. ####<meld>neutral
I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling. ####<meld>neutral
Oh?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, but without the costumes. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
And its not fake, its totally brutal. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre ####<meld>neutral
So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking. ####<meld>neutral
Whats fish hooking? ####<meld>surprise
Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste? ####<meld>neutral
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. ####<meld>sadness
Well, that makes me feel so good. ####<meld>joy
It was just so awkward and bumpy. ####<meld>neutral
Bumpy? ####<meld>surprise
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. ####<meld>neutral
And uh maybe you have to get used to it. ####<meld>neutral
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean? ####<meld>joy
Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through! ####<meld>fear
Oh well, its not so bad. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms. ####<meld>sadness
Oh! ####<meld>surprise
My God! ####<meld>surprise
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday? ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me? ####<meld>surprise
Joey! Hes working!  You would look ####<meld>anger
Oh, how bad is it? ####<meld>sadness
Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do ####<meld>sadness
Hows your room Rach? ####<meld>neutral
Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. ####<meld>sadness
Isnt that mine? ####<meld>neutral
Fine! Im sorry for your loss! ####<meld>anger
So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay? ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am ####<meld>joy
Yes, they can stay with us. ####<meld>neutral
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman? ####<meld>neutral
Theres just so much pressure. ####<meld>anger
I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. ####<meld>neutral
I dont know if youd understand. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. ####<meld>neutral
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! ####<meld>sadness
I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time. ####<meld>fear
So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly! ####<meld>anger
Ross, we can handle this. ####<meld>neutral
Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. ####<meld>sadness
I mean, enough of the silliness! ####<meld>anger
Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly! ####<meld>anger
Okay-okay! ####<meld>anger
Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. ####<meld>sadness
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? ####<meld>sadness
That is so silly. ####<meld>joy
Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness? ####<meld>neutral
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. ####<meld>neutral
Love is the best medicine. ####<meld>joy
Thats laughter. ####<meld>joy
Why do you do it? ####<meld>neutral
I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I do. ####<meld>neutral
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya? ####<meld>neutral
Yes. ####<meld>neutral
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! ####<meld>joy
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
But I don't. Me, Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way. ####<meld>neutral
You're not? See, that's why you're so great! ####<meld>surprise
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! ####<meld>anger
Define me! ####<meld>anger
Love me, I need love! ####<meld>anger
Have you really done this before? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
You just take a big, big swing. ####<meld>neutral
Now, dont hold back. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey-hey! ####<meld>joy
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back. ####<meld>joy
Oh, all right. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you. ####<meld>joy
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood. ####<meld>joy
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Bye! ####<meld>neutral
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day! ####<meld>anger
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese? ####<meld>neutral
Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday. ####<meld>neutral
Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers. ####<meld>neutral
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials? ####<meld>neutral
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down? ####<meld>neutral
Because we can remember them. ####<meld>neutral
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night? ####<meld>anger
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played ####<meld>neutral
I was always Joanne. ####<meld>neutral
Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood? ####<meld>neutral
Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King! ####<meld>disgust
Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel! ####<meld>disgust
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine. ####<meld>joy
What a wank! ####<meld>anger
Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses. ####<meld>anger
I know! ####<meld>anger
And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. ####<meld>anger
And Im appalled for you by the way. ####<meld>anger
You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone. ####<meld>sadness
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food. ####<meld>disgust
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. ####<meld>disgust
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Im, Im freaking out! ####<meld>fear
Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have! ####<meld>fear
All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. ####<meld>neutral
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom? ####<meld>neutral
Um. yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I am ####<meld>neutral
All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. ####<meld>neutral
So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. ####<meld>neutral
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work. ####<meld>anger
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here. ####<meld>neutral
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me! ####<meld>anger
Like me tiny doctor! ####<meld>anger
Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me? ####<meld>sadness
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along. ####<meld>anger
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. ####<meld>anger
Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too! ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels. ####<meld>neutral
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear? ####<meld>neutral
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. ####<meld>neutral
Really? A purse? ####<meld>surprise
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag. ####<meld>anger
It looks like a women's purse. ####<meld>neutral
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look, ####<meld>neutral
See look, ####<meld>neutral
Exactly! Unisex! ####<meld>neutral
Maybe you need sex. ####<meld>neutral
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex. ####<meld>joy
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that. ####<meld>neutral
So, um, have you told your parents? ####<meld>neutral
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . . ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. ####<meld>neutral

Oh my god, I am losing my mind. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross! ####<meld>anger

There shouldnt be all this rules and restrictions! ####<meld>anger

Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. ####<meld>anger
So, I hear, you hate me! ####<meld>anger
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that. ####<meld>neutral
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me. ####<meld>anger
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there... ####<meld>fear
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. ####<meld>anger
So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together. ####<meld>neutral
But what does that gonna do... ####<meld>anger

Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad. ####<meld>neutral
Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress. ####<meld>neutral
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress. ####<meld>joy
But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then. ####<meld>neutral
Honey, it isnt good luck. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Monica! ####<meld>surprise

All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked. ####<meld>surprise

Its not for me, its for Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
But Rachel has an apartment. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move. ####<meld>neutral
She is? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you? ####<meld>surprise
I guess I didnt really think about it. ####<meld>neutral
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel! ####<meld>anger
Damnit! ####<meld>anger
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people? ####<meld>surprise

Oh, that is so sweet! ####<meld>joy
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these! ####<meld>joy
Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them. ####<meld>neutral
Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies. ####<meld>sadness
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever! ####<meld>sadness
Wait a minute! ####<meld>surprise
Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant. ####<meld>joy
Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila. ####<meld>neutral

Oh, shes gonna love that! ####<meld>joy
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment? ####<meld>neutral
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out. ####<meld>neutral
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable. ####<meld>neutral
Fine, Im mentally unstable. ####<meld>anger
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Uh yes, heroin and crack. ####<meld>neutral
Crack isnt even an intravenous drug! ####<meld>anger
Well, you would know. ####<meld>neutral
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, come on! ####<meld>sadness
Ross, please, I found the magazines! ####<meld>sadness
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked. ####<meld>neutral
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door? ####<meld>joy
I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby! ####<meld>sadness
Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there . ####<meld>neutral

Yeah, thats our baby. ####<meld>joy
Gin. ####<meld>neutral
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked. ####<meld>joy
Will you stop! ####<meld>joy
Okay. All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you. ####<meld>joy

You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby? ####<meld>fear
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine. ####<meld>neutral
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. ####<meld>joy
I can't believe    I didn't even think of that. ####<meld>surprise
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'... ####<meld>sadness
What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office? ####<meld>anger
It was a "Wendy's!!    " ####<meld>anger
...and then Zana, just let one rip!! ####<meld>surprise
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? ####<meld>disgust

Yeah! ####<meld>anger
Well, Im not going to go now anyway . ####<meld>neutral
Okay . ####<meld>neutral
Here you go. ####<meld>neutral
Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff. ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you want, you can work here. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, I dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow? ####<meld>neutral
And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Flexible hours. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone? ####<meld>neutral
I have no name. ####<meld>neutral

Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it. ####<meld>neutral

Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love. ####<meld>neutral
No! I mean come on! This is a ####<meld>anger

Are they in love? ####<meld>joy
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
You don't know anything. ####<meld>anger
Ohh, I know one thing! ####<meld>joy
What? ####<meld>joy
They did it right there on the couch. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. ####<meld>anger
I mean, that guy with the toe thing? ####<meld>anger
Who's he sleeping with? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... ####<meld>neutral
I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-! ####<meld>joy
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work. ####<meld>neutral
So where did you study? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I didn't go to college. ####<meld>neutral
No, where did you study acting? ####<meld>neutral
Molly ... people don't study acting ... ####<meld>neutral
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Sure, I'll go check on Emma. ####<meld>neutral
Thanx. ####<meld>neutral
Will the stable boy never get the princess?? ####<meld>sadness
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch? ####<meld>disgust
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. ####<meld>disgust
You know, this isn't fair. ####<meld>anger
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? ####<meld>anger
Huh? ####<meld>anger
Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real? ####<meld>anger
Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok? ####<meld>sadness
I didn't think I could ever love again. ####<meld>sadness
Come on! Joe! ####<meld>joy
Hi, is Molly here? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, come on in. Molly? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow. ####<meld>neutral
Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem. ####<meld>neutral
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian! ####<meld>joy
And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right? ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
My whole familys from Naples! ####<meld>joy

Not a problem. ####<meld>neutral
I totally understand. ####<meld>neutral
You need to yknow make sure I dont have any horrible scars or tattoos. ####<meld>neutral
Dont you worry. I have nothing to hide. ####<meld>neutral
So there you go, thats me. ####<meld>neutral
One hundred percent natural! ####<meld>joy

This rooms available. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! ####<meld>joy
Okay wait! ####<meld>anger
You listen to me! ####<meld>anger
You listen to me! ####<meld>anger
Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! ####<meld>anger
Im next! ####<meld>anger
Its my turn! ####<meld>anger
Its only fair! ####<meld>anger
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you! ####<meld>anger
Not this hospital, Im going to sue you! ####<meld>anger
And my husband  hes a lawyer! ####<meld>anger
Uh Rach ####<meld>neutral
Go get back on that case honey! ####<meld>anger
I dont think the next patient is very far along. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well then bring her in. ####<meld>neutral
OH.MY.GAWD!!! ####<meld>surprise
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge! ####<meld>fear
They dont look any bigger than me! ####<meld>neutral
Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are. ####<meld>anger
Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right? ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa!  I kinda liked it. ####<meld>joy
Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross.  Yknow, Red Ross! ####<meld>anger
I totally dont know what youre talking about. ####<meld>neutral
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for ####<meld>anger
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture. ####<meld>joy
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy. ####<meld>neutral
We just want you to think it through. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom? ####<meld>neutral
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, thank you for meeting with me. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you. All right. ####<meld>neutral
Come, sit. ####<meld>neutral
Sit. ####<meld>neutral
Sit! ####<meld>anger
Umm, all righty, before we get started I justI need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay. ####<meld>neutral
Lucky sixes.... ####<meld>neutral
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
And Joey.... ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
And Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
He doesn't speak much English. ####<meld>neutral
Look at that! ####<meld>surprise
So, um... where did Paolo come from? ####<meld>neutral
Oh... Italy, I think. ####<meld>neutral
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives. ####<meld>neutral
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat! ####<meld>neutral
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him. ####<meld>neutral
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat. ####<meld>neutral
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo. ####<meld>joy
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
You betcha! ####<meld>joy
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?! ####<meld>surprise
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out. ####<meld>neutral
That cup is mine! ####<meld>anger
No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it! ####<meld>anger
All right, so are we not having dinner at all? ####<meld>sadness
Why? ####<meld>sadness
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon. ####<meld>neutral
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey. ####<meld>neutral
I know I do. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Guess what? ####<meld>neutral
They published my paper. ####<meld>joy
Oh, really, let me see, let me see. ####<meld>joy
Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is. ####<meld>joy
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
What?! You got us evicted!! ####<meld>anger
I told you not to go down there! ####<meld>anger
Well he made Rachel cry! ####<meld>disgust
Rachel always cries! ####<meld>anger
Thats not true! ####<meld>anger
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before! ####<meld>neutral
All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled. ####<meld>neutral
Go!! ####<meld>anger
All right, all right, all right. ####<meld>neutral
I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it. ####<meld>neutral
So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him? ####<meld>joy
Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job. ####<meld>neutral
How ya feelin? ####<meld>neutral
Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it. ####<meld>neutral
Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone. ####<meld>neutral
Woooo hoooo!!! ####<meld>joy
Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing. ####<meld>anger
Why, what happened? ####<meld>surprise
Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part. ####<meld>sadness
What is the worse part? ####<meld>neutral
I cant remember which sister. ####<meld>sadness
You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!! ####<meld>anger
Whats wrong with you? ####<meld>anger
Nothing! ####<meld>anger
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. ####<meld>sadness
But um, I dont think its anything serious. ####<meld>neutral
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor! ####<meld>surprise
No way! ####<meld>anger
Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! ####<meld>anger
Why did I have to start working out again? ####<meld>disgust
Damn you 15s! ####<meld>anger
Its a trifle. ####<meld>neutral
Its got all of these layers. ####<meld>neutral
First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. ####<meld>neutral
[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.] ####<meld>neutral
then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top! ####<meld>neutral
It tastes like feet! ####<meld>disgust
I like it. ####<meld>joy
Are you kidding? ####<meld>surprise
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute? ####<meld>neutral
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox. ####<meld>neutral
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries! ####<meld>joy
Oh, oh! It's on again! ####<meld>joy
You guys, can we please not watch this all right. ####<meld>disgust
Shhhh! ####<meld>anger
Folks, has this ever happened to you. ####<meld>neutral
You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way! ####<meld>anger
And there is Kevin. ####<meld>neutral
Can we please turn this off? ####<meld>sadness
Noo way, Kevin. ####<meld>joy
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000. ####<meld>neutral
Are you intrigued? ####<meld>surprise
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am! ####<meld>joy
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. ####<meld>neutral
Go ahead. ####<meld>neutral
This works with any milk carton. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday. ####<meld>surprise
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay. ####<meld>neutral
She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is ####<meld>anger
Good day for married people huh? ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry your husband cheated on you. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either. ####<meld>sadness
Try telling my wife that. ####<meld>sadness
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife? ####<meld>neutral
I can't wait to be with you! ####<meld>joy
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. ####<meld>neutral
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours. ####<meld>neutral
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? ####<meld>joy
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big ####<meld>joy
Arghh!! ####<meld>disgust
I cant believe Im going to lose this job! ####<meld>sadness
Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard. ####<meld>neutral

Why should I help you?! ####<meld>anger

What do you need? ####<meld>neutral
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yknow Sarah? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>surprise
And I too am just a love machine. ####<meld>neutral
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is. ####<meld>neutral

See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in! ####<meld>joy
You chipped in?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! ####<meld>anger
Y'know? ####<meld>neutral
This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. ####<meld>joy
That's always fun to be. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, but you're making me look bad! ####<meld>anger
No I'm not. ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>surprise
If anything I'm making you look better! ####<meld>joy
They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit! ####<meld>joy
Oh hey, Pheebs! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Oh hey, Ross. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. ####<meld>fear
Something to think about. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, okay, my bad. ####<meld>joy

Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? ####<meld>neutral
Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? ####<meld>neutral

Yeah, she was bald, shes not now. ####<meld>neutral
How could you not tell me that she has hair? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, well, this is just perfect! ####<meld>anger
Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got ####<meld>anger

Why, does she have a bad personality? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, Bonnies the best! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy

Then don't break in!! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed. ####<meld>anger
I have the lung capacity of a two year old. ####<meld>neutral
Then why are you smoking? ####<meld>disgust
Well its very unsettling. ####<meld>sadness
Honey, I was wondering.... ####<meld>neutral
Hmm? ####<meld>neutral
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform? ####<meld>joy
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place. ####<meld>sadness
Hmm. ####<meld>neutral
I think I have an old band uniform from high school. ####<meld>joy
You remember not having sex in high school, right? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah. ####<meld>sadness
Well honey, what about you? ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things? ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>neutral
Come on you gotta have one! ####<meld>surprise
Ugh! ####<meld>disgust
I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler. ####<meld>anger
Not at these prices. ####<meld>anger
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo! ####<meld>joy
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy. ####<meld>joy
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh! ####<meld>surprise
Oh my God! ####<meld>surprise
Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends. ####<meld>joy
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes. ####<meld>joy
Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters? ####<meld>joy
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. ####<meld>anger
That's OK. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, are you sure? ####<meld>surprise
Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. ####<meld>anger
We can't do that. ####<meld>neutral
What? What can't you do? ####<meld>surprise
She really said that? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... ####<meld>neutral
But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight. ####<meld>neutral
'Tonight' tonight? ####<meld>surprise
Well, I think it's perfect. ####<meld>joy
Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey... ####<meld>neutral
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. ####<meld>sadness
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her. ####<meld>joy
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used. ####<meld>disgust
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon? ####<meld>neutral
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough. ####<meld>neutral
Alright, well, be good, I love you. ####<meld>joy
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect. ####<meld>anger
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid. ####<meld>sadness
Really stupid. ####<meld>anger
Really stupid. ####<meld>sadness
And I don't even know how it happened. ####<meld>sadness
I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. ####<meld>sadness
Are we okay now? ####<meld>fear
Yeah. No. No... ####<meld>anger
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door. ####<meld>neutral
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. ####<meld>neutral
You're kidding. ####<meld>surprise
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?" ####<meld>neutral
Oh there it is. ####<meld>neutral
Thats not your regular dry cleaners. ####<meld>neutral
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. ####<meld>disgust
I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store ####<meld>disgust
What?! ####<meld>surprise
A new grocery store. ####<meld>neutral
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me? ####<meld>anger
When I get up there Im going to kick some ass. ####<meld>anger
Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, we both can. And we both will. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you didnt have to come in with me. ####<meld>neutral
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like ####<meld>joy
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow! ####<meld>surprise
What? ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful. ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do? ####<meld>neutral
I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing? ####<meld>joy
A little.   Now youre talking. ####<meld>neutral
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee? ####<meld>neutral
I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend. ####<meld>joy
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out? ####<meld>joy
She mustve left. ####<meld>neutral
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team! ####<meld>anger
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours? ####<meld>surprise
That's right baby. ####<meld>joy
All right, let me in. ####<meld>neutral
No-no! Don't do it! Don't! ####<meld>fear
What? ####<meld>surprise
He's a dropper! ####<meld>anger
Oh yeah, that's right! ####<meld>anger
I'm not a dropper! ####<meld>anger
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know? ####<meld>neutral
It's throwing and catching! ####<meld>anger
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Oh! That's so hard. ####<meld>surprise
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat! ####<meld>anger
Oh myOh good God! ####<meld>surprise
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing! ####<meld>anger
Baking it didn't help, huh? ####<meld>neutral
All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later. ####<meld>neutral
Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me? ####<meld>neutral
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey! ####<meld>surprise
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that! ####<meld>neutral
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays. ####<meld>neutral
Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day! ####<meld>joy
So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. ####<meld>joy
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand. ####<meld>anger
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand. ####<meld>disgust
I was shrieking... like a Marine. ####<meld>neutral
All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache. ####<meld>neutral
She's not much of a phone person. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no. ####<meld>anger
Ok, look, maybe I should just go. ####<meld>neutral
Maybe you should. ####<meld>anger
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? ####<meld>sadness
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that is so not true. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, it is. ####<meld>neutral
It isn't. ####<meld>neutral
It is. ####<meld>neutral
Isn't! ####<meld>anger
Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there. ####<meld>neutral
Its a great class. ####<meld>joy
Thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next? ####<meld>fear
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them ####<meld>neutral
No. No-no. No. What would ####<meld>anger
Who? Me the attacker? ####<meld>surprise
Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better. ####<meld>sadness
No-noReally?! ####<meld>surprise
Of course! ####<meld>joy
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh ####<meld>sadness
Ohh, Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Well maybe there is one thing you can do. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Anything! Anything! ####<meld>joy
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. ####<meld>neutral
This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday? ####<meld>fear
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie? ####<meld>surprise
Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials! ####<meld>sadness
Theyre all Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good! ####<meld>surprise
I did.  But it came at a price. ####<meld>neutral
But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this. ####<meld>fear
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?! ####<meld>surprise
Sure! ####<meld>joy
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? ####<meld>neutral
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! ####<meld>joy
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! ####<meld>joy
Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I like that idea. ####<meld>joy
Obviously! ####<meld>joy
I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like ####<meld>neutral
No. ####<meld>disgust
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely." ####<meld>joy
Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no. ####<meld>disgust
So, thats it? ####<meld>surprise
I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques. ####<meld>neutral
Which is why ####<meld>neutral
What do you have against the beautiful guest room? ####<meld>anger
I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away! ####<meld>anger
Are you mocking me? ####<meld>anger
No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey! ####<meld>joy
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed. ####<meld>joy
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but ####<meld>neutral
Cat. ####<meld>neutral
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you. ####<meld>joy
I love you too. ####<meld>joy
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was! ####<meld>neutral
Why? ####<meld>surprise
I don't know. ####<meld>neutral
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments! ####<meld>joy
That's ####<meld>neutral
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has ####<meld>neutral
But ####<meld>neutral
No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!" ####<meld>disgust
Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today. ####<meld>neutral
Why not?! ####<meld>anger
Because Im dumping him today. ####<meld>neutral
What?! You said he was sweet! ####<meld>surprise
He ####<meld>neutral
Just dont pick up your phone. ####<meld>neutral
Then he comes over!  "Im so worried about you." Uck! Be a man! ####<meld>disgust
What? So now Im not allowed to fire him? ####<meld>surprise
You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself. ####<meld>sadness
Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week. ####<meld>neutral
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill ####<meld>disgust
Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it! ####<meld>neutral
Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch. ####<meld>sadness
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I-I guess I gotta go. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone? ####<meld>sadness
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. ####<meld>sadness
Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>anger
Chandler! ####<meld>surprise
Janice! ####<meld>surprise
There you are! ####<meld>surprise
There you are! ####<meld>surprise
I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane! ####<meld>sadness
No! No! I wanna see you take-off. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you? ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes. ####<meld>neutral
Was she happy you gave her the job? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant. ####<meld>neutral
Hello? ####<meld>neutral
Oh hey! ####<meld>surprise
Can you, can you hang on a second? ####<meld>neutral
Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. ####<meld>neutral
can you excuse me for a minute? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, funny you should call. ####<meld>joy
I was just looking over next weeks script. ####<meld>neutral
Canceled?! ####<meld>surprise
Like theyre taking it off the air? ####<meld>surprise
Ohh. ####<meld>neutral
All right, see you Monday. ####<meld>neutral
Were not even shootin them anymore?!! ####<meld>surprise
All right, bye! ####<meld>anger
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E! ####<meld>anger
Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Im sorry Joey. ####<meld>sadness
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?! ####<meld>surprise
Its so secluded up here. ####<meld>neutral
I know. I like it up here. ####<meld>joy
I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry. ####<meld>joy
Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse? ####<meld>neutral
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that? ####<meld>fear
Honey, we dont have any bears here. ####<meld>neutral
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a ####<meld>neutral
Okay. Ill be right back. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?! ####<meld>surprise

Yeah, I recognize the ankles! ####<meld>neutral
Get up! ####<meld>anger
Here you go honey! ####<meld>joy
Ahh. Thank you! ####<meld>joy
Diet Coke ####<meld>neutral
What the hell was that?! ####<meld>anger
A lesson in the importance of unagi. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, ####<meld>neutral
Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to ####<meld>neutral
All right, so we werent ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Im leaning. This is where I lean. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch. ####<meld>neutral
Brenda a bee! ####<meld>fear
What? ####<meld>surprise
Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you! ####<meld>anger
I think I know whats going on here. ####<meld>disgust
You do? ####<meld>neutral
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married. ####<meld>disgust
I totally understand.  Can I ####<meld>neutral
All right, let's do it! ####<meld>joy
No, no, no. What was that? ####<meld>surprise
I know, it was the best I could get out of them. ####<meld>neutral
Well, people! ####<meld>sadness
People, people, people. ####<meld>neutral
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Show 'em how it's done. ####<meld>neutral
Count it off. ####<meld>neutral
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years. ####<meld>disgust
Yeah, invite him? ####<meld>neutral
Hey, did I do these neat enough? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, theyre fine. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>joy
If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then? ####<meld>surprise
Sure. Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there. ####<meld>sadness
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her? ####<meld>fear
Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you. ####<meld>sadness
But its absolutely your decision. ####<meld>neutral
More tea? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah sure. ####<meld>neutral
Earl Grey? ####<meld>neutral
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey! So how was the doctor? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, everything went great. ####<meld>joy
Good. ####<meld>neutral
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>joy
I dont see the baby. Where is it? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again. ####<meld>joy
Could you help me with something? ####<meld>neutral
The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. ####<meld>neutral
And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive. ####<meld>neutral
I think I know who youre talking about. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in? ####<meld>joy
Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff ####<meld>neutral
Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray. ####<meld>neutral
Dr. Drake who? ####<meld>neutral
Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information. Im a doctor. ####<meld>neutral
A doctor at this hospital? ####<meld>surprise
Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head? ####<meld>anger
Hands. ####<meld>neutral
Hands! ####<meld>neutral
It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. ####<meld>neutral
Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years! ####<meld>neutral
Hes in room 816. ####<meld>neutral
816, thank you! ####<meld>joy
Thank you. ####<meld>neutral
And what is his name? ####<meld>neutral
No! ####<meld>surprise
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned. ####<meld>neutral
Awww. ####<meld>joy
Thanks a million. ####<meld>joy
Oh, youre welcome a million. ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ill see you in our room. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
I know. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa! What?! Why?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie. ####<meld>sadness
Here?! Now?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, yeah. ####<meld>neutral
I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff. ####<meld>fear
What happened? ####<meld>surprise
Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago. ####<meld>sadness
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky! ####<meld>joy
Stupid, useless Canadian money! ####<meld>anger
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen. ####<meld>neutral
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Will you call him? ####<meld>neutral
Yes! ####<meld>joy
I will! ####<meld>joy
Absolutely! ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! That is so good! ####<meld>joy
Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
What do you got there? ####<meld>neutral
Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some? ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing tonight? ####<meld>neutral
Huh? Uh ####<meld>neutral
Dude! Dude! ####<meld>surprise
Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why? ####<meld>neutral
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00. ####<meld>surprise
What?! Tonight?! ####<meld>surprise
Thats what Monica said. ####<meld>neutral
After she gave me that big speech?! ####<meld>surprise
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? ####<meld>anger
I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy! ####<meld>anger
Okay, is this lamp in the same place? ####<meld>neutral
Who cares? I repel women. ####<meld>disgust
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked. ####<meld>surprise
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Its yours! ####<meld>neutral
Yeah well, Im-Im a slut. ####<meld>sadness
Me too. ####<meld>neutral
Hi Jill! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi . ####<meld>neutral
Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not! ####<meld>joy
Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight. ####<meld>neutral
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it! ####<meld>anger
I'm sorry, man. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, y'know what you should do? ####<meld>neutral
You should make something happen for yourself. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, like-like write a play. ####<meld>neutral
Write a movie! ####<meld>joy
Huh? ####<meld>neutral
I mean, what about those ####<meld>neutral
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it? ####<meld>sadness
Wait a second, I could star in it! ####<meld>joy
Or that. ####<meld>neutral
I can't write! ####<meld>anger
Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? ####<meld>sadness
I can't do it. ####<meld>sadness
I'll help you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. ####<meld>neutral
And plus, it'll give me something to do. ####<meld>neutral
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. ####<meld>neutral
Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star. ####<meld>neutral
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good. ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do. ####<meld>neutral
Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize. ####<meld>neutral
I would really love it if I could do both. ####<meld>neutral
All right, II have to ask. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>neutral
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again? ####<meld>fear
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained? ####<meld>anger
A hundred and forty-five pounds. ####<meld>disgust
Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?! ####<meld>anger
Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me? ####<meld>joy
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her. ####<meld>anger
Frannie was the one who found your ####<meld>neutral
That bitch! ####<meld>anger
Monica! What ####<meld>surprise
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?! ####<meld>anger
Hi Frannie, congratulations. ####<meld>neutral
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! ####<meld>anger
Why?! ####<meld>surprise
WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding? ####<meld>anger
What could I have possibly done?! ####<meld>anger
Stuart! ####<meld>anger
I believe you know my husband. ####<meld>neutral
So its really a question of ####<meld>neutral
Hey ladies! What are you in here for? ####<meld>neutral
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here? ####<meld>surprise
Gary, I'm here to report a crime. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together. ####<meld>neutral
What's up? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. ####<meld>neutral
Man to uh, me. ####<meld>neutral
Sure. Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy. ####<meld>neutral
You mean scared. ####<meld>neutral
No, I mean happy. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff. ####<meld>joy
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in. ####<meld>sadness
What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right? ####<meld>surprise
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room. ####<meld>neutral
What?! Over a stupid room! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here! ####<meld>joy
Oh no, yeah no, that parts great! ####<meld>joy
Shut-out!! ####<meld>surprise
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game! ####<meld>surprise
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning! ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, get out! ####<meld>anger
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! ####<meld>anger
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? ####<meld>anger
Come on, wussies! ####<meld>anger
All right, ok, I gotta go. ####<meld>neutral
I'm going,  and I'm gone. ####<meld>neutral
One more game? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
Im sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Ohhh. Dont go. ####<meld>sadness
No, I-I-I gotta go. ####<meld>sadness
No. No! No! No! ####<meld>sadness
Honey, honey, people are looking. ####<meld>sadness
I dont care!  I dont care!! ####<meld>anger
Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now. ####<meld>sadness
You cant leave! I have your shoe! ####<meld>sadness
Good-bye Chandler Bing. ####<meld>sadness
Rachel has those in burgendy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, ew! ####<meld>disgust
What? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. ####<meld>neutral
Um, can you roll your tongue? ####<meld>neutral
Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad. ####<meld>neutral
What, wait, you mean like this? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. ####<meld>surprise
Your not doing it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that.... ####<meld>neutral
Where there is no fear of commitment. ####<meld>neutral
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. ####<meld>neutral
But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. ####<meld>neutral
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! ####<meld>fear
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. ####<meld>neutral
Right. ####<meld>neutral
In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was. ####<meld>neutral
Amazingly, that makes sense. ####<meld>joy
You think? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way. ####<meld>fear
Hey!  Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center. ####<meld>joy
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating? ####<meld>joy
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. ####<meld>neutral
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together? ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts! ####<meld>surprise
Im missin picture time?! ####<meld>joy
Yknow she has a face Ross! ####<meld>anger
Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us. ####<meld>joy
Wow! ####<meld>joy
That is a good one! ####<meld>joy
Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow. ####<meld>joy
Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. ####<meld>neutral
Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together? ####<meld>neutral
Together? Like-like to people? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay? ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>joy
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later? ####<meld>neutral
Uh sure, sure. ####<meld>neutral
Bye guys. ####<meld>neutral
I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore. ####<meld>anger
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend? ####<meld>anger
Is this about Mark? ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Okay, its not, its not. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break. ####<meld>sadness
Fine, youre right. ####<meld>neutral
Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. ####<meld>neutral
No. A break from us. ####<meld>sadness
Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock. ####<meld>joy
Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work. ####<meld>joy
Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then. ####<meld>neutral
Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either. ####<meld>neutral
Oh? Why not? ####<meld>neutral
Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament. ####<meld>neutral
Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something? ####<meld>anger
Well now-now youre just talking crazy. ####<meld>joy
So why cant the three of us go out together? ####<meld>neutral
Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me. ####<meld>sadness
Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. ####<meld>sadness
And the way she looked at me, pure lust. ####<meld>joy
Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya? ####<meld>anger
Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. ####<meld>neutral
Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club. ####<meld>joy
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch. ####<meld>anger
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. ####<meld>neutral
It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep. ####<meld>neutral
: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon! ####<meld>anger
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy. ####<meld>neutral
What are you doing? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom. ####<meld>neutral
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over. ####<meld>neutral
Did he call? ####<meld>neutral
No. Sorry. ####<meld>sadness
Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called? ####<meld>sadness
Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women. ####<meld>neutral
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why? ####<meld>anger
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss. ####<meld>neutral
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward? ####<meld>surprise
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you? ####<meld>anger
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that. ####<meld>anger
And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry? ####<meld>sadness
I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion! ####<meld>anger
Is that too much to ask after six years?! ####<meld>anger
I mean what? ####<meld>anger
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! ####<meld>anger
I mean do we not have as much fun?! ####<meld>anger
Dont I deserve a few tears?!! ####<meld>sadness
I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out! ####<meld>sadness
Hey! ####<meld>anger
I did not cry my eyes out!! ####<meld>anger
Come on! ####<meld>sadness
Its like the end of an era! ####<meld>sadness
No more J-man and Channies! ####<meld>sadness
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?! ####<meld>anger
Do I know why were rushing? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? ####<meld>neutral
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I found it! ####<meld>joy
Thats so great for you guys! ####<meld>joy
Good luck, with your girlfriend. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!! ####<meld>joy
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time. ####<meld>neutral
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? ####<meld>neutral
Yes, you can, very much. ####<meld>joy
Ahhhh!! ####<meld>surprise
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table! ####<meld>joy
Do ####<meld>neutral
Ah, ####<meld>neutral
Do ####<meld>neutral
Ah, ####<meld>neutral
DO YOU? ####<meld>anger
Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, come on. ####<meld>disgust
Hey! ####<meld>sadness
All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! ####<meld>joy
And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. ####<meld>neutral
And what you said about Nana. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. ####<meld>sadness
And you know what? ####<meld>neutral
I think she was. ####<meld>neutral
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it? ####<meld>surprise
You forget how many great songs Heart had. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard. ####<meld>neutral
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it. ####<meld>neutral
What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey. ####<meld>neutral
And monkeys cant write out prescriptions. ####<meld>neutral
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke. ####<meld>anger
Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars. ####<meld>neutral
I cant find garbage bags! ####<meld>anger
Oh, I think I saw some in here. ####<meld>neutral
What is it?! ####<meld>surprise
I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die. ####<meld>disgust
I cant believe were living here! ####<meld>sadness
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really  proposing? ####<meld>surprise
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out. ####<meld>anger
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?! ####<meld>surprise
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it. ####<meld>anger
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out. ####<meld>sadness
Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, look, just do it gently. ####<meld>neutral
You’re right. ####<meld>neutral
You’re right. ####<meld>neutral
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle. ####<meld>neutral
I can do that. ####<meld>neutral
I am a gentle person. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, by the  way. ####<meld>neutral
Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. ####<meld>sadness
Which ####<meld>neutral
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else? ####<meld>neutral
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which ####<meld>joy
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here ####<meld>joy
You completely stole my answer! ####<meld>anger
Well, honey that was pretty obvious. ####<meld>sadness
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it! ####<meld>anger
What do you think? You in the blue shirt. ####<meld>neutral
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers. ####<meld>neutral
Would ya care to venture one? ####<meld>neutral
Would ####<meld>neutral
Are you just repeating what I'm saying? ####<meld>anger
All right, let's move on. ####<meld>neutral
Okay then. ####<meld>neutral
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. ####<meld>neutral
And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wont recognise you because, well, why would she? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. ####<meld>neutral
You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Ill be uh, Mr. Wong. ####<meld>neutral
Diverse. ####<meld>neutral
Did anybody call for security? ####<meld>neutral
You be cool. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk?  Hey, Joey? ####<meld>neutral
Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it? ####<meld>fear
Way to be cool, man. ####<meld>neutral
Whats he talking about? ####<meld>neutral
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone! ####<meld>anger
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring? ####<meld>surprise
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess! ####<meld>anger
Okay, who are you? ####<meld>surprise
The Hardy boys? ####<meld>anger
Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right? ####<meld>anger
I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that? ####<meld>anger
Marry me. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Joey! ####<meld>surprise
Hell yeah! Ill marry you! ####<meld>joy
You cant marry him! ####<meld>anger
Hey lady, your days over! Its my turn! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe! ####<meld>surprise
Why?! Why cant she marry me?! ####<meld>surprise
I can and I will! ####<meld>anger
Shes not pregnant. Its Rachel. Rachels the one whos pregnant. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>anger
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnt have a baby in nine months! ####<meld>anger
Its Joey! ####<meld>surprise
Now I cant believe it! What? Rachels pregnant?  Whos the father? ####<meld>surprise
We dont know. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh I wonder if that dude. ####<meld>neutral
Theres a dude? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Who? Who is it? ####<meld>surprise
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnt see who it was but ####<meld>disgust
Was that story over? ####<meld>neutral
The guy left this. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! I know who the father is ####<meld>surprise
People have got to finish their stories! ####<meld>anger
Oh my God, youre back! ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! ####<meld>surprise
Why do you want to see my hand? ####<meld>neutral
I wanna see whats in your hand. I wanna see the trash. ####<meld>disgust
Eww! Oh, its all dirty. You should throw this out. ####<meld>disgust
No! ####<meld>anger
Me too! ####<meld>joy
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we dont wanna look stupid! ####<meld>joy
Alright were back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! ####<meld>joy
Three, Two, One! ####<meld>neutral

Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits. ####<meld>neutral
They are completely differentOkay! ####<meld>anger
Okay! ####<meld>surprise

Those contracts absolutely had to go out today! ####<meld>anger
Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts! ####<meld>surprise
Yes I did! And I put a little ####<meld>anger
Im telling you, you never gave them to me. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk. ####<meld>anger
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are ####<meld>anger
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch! ####<meld>disgust
You wanna go down to the office right now? ####<meld>neutral
No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office. ####<meld>anger
Okay I understand.  I wouldnt want to be proved wrong either. ####<meld>neutral

Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? ####<meld>neutral
Oh right, Coach Ruben. ####<meld>neutral
Do you know what Pheebs? ####<meld>neutral
When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. ####<meld>fear
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. ####<meld>neutral
See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense. ####<meld>neutral
What do you mean? ####<meld>surprise
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week! ####<meld>anger
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here! ####<meld>anger

Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? ####<meld>anger
I mean,... how needy is that? ####<meld>disgust
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon? ####<meld>neutral
You're so pretty. ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hey, Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral

Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  Youre the other one right? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on. ####<meld>sadness
What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make! ####<meld>surprise
Theres nothing sexual about this? ####<meld>anger
Oo God! ####<meld>sadness
What are you looking at?! ####<meld>anger
I mean hi. ####<meld>neutral
Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again! ####<meld>fear
No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages! ####<meld>sadness
No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do! ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it. ####<meld>neutral
Are you sure? ####<meld>surprise
Yes. ####<meld>neutral

Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough. ####<meld>disgust
Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight. ####<meld>neutral
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party? ####<meld>neutral
Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby ####<meld>sadness
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think? ####<meld>neutral
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding. ####<meld>neutral
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding! ####<meld>joy
Oh, what a fun office. ####<meld>joy
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. ####<meld>neutral
So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back? ####<meld>neutral
Rachel? Do you smoke? ####<meld>neutral
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke. ####<meld>neutral
What? ####<meld>neutral
Peach pit. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, Bunny? ####<meld>neutral
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had- ####<meld>neutral
-Peaches? ####<meld>neutral
Actually, nectarines, but basically... ####<meld>neutral
Could've been a peach. ####<meld>neutral
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. ####<meld>joy
All right! ####<meld>joy
Westminster Abbey! ####<meld>joy
Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen. ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place. ####<meld>neutral
Really? To what? ####<meld>surprise
To Put the Camera Away!!! ####<meld>anger
Man, ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, theres a guy right over there. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a mailman! Thats ####<meld>surprise
Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy! ####<meld>neutral
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that? ####<meld>neutral
Eh..., I dont, I dont know. ####<meld>sadness
What? ####<meld>neutral
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing? ####<meld>sadness
Rachel? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new? ####<meld>joy
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever. ####<meld>neutral
Eh, do you believe that? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby. ####<meld>anger
No, you said the baby creeps you out. ####<meld>neutral
No, the little girl creeps me out. ####<meld>anger
You said the baby. ####<meld>neutral
Why would the baby creep me out? ####<meld>anger
Why would the little girl creep you out? ####<meld>anger
You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower? ####<meld>neutral
This is going in your book? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great! ####<meld>joy
What?! Excuse me! ####<meld>surprise
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. ####<meld>neutral
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I made it! ####<meld>joy
Im on time! ####<meld>joy
Okay, why dont we all uh,  open our books to page 23. ####<meld>neutral
Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots. ####<meld>neutral
Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right? ####<meld>anger
Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? ####<meld>neutral
What the? What ####<meld>surprise
Miss? May I help you? ####<meld>neutral
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? ####<meld>fear
But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. ####<meld>neutral
So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ####<meld>sadness
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? ####<meld>neutral
Do you want me to be afraid of you? ####<meld>neutral
Of course not. ####<meld>neutral
I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. ####<meld>joy
I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that. ####<meld>joy
Really? ####<meld>surprise
Of course! ####<meld>neutral
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me. ####<meld>joy
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit ####<meld>neutral
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is ####<meld>anger
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy! ####<meld>disgust
Ooh, it's not a toy. ####<meld>anger
Well, I don't know what else to do. ####<meld>sadness
I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! ####<meld>anger
So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! ####<meld>anger
'Cause I-I got nothing! ####<meld>anger
All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. ####<meld>anger
Okay then. ####<meld>neutral
Here we go. ####<meld>neutral
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? ####<meld>neutral
Ask again later. ####<meld>neutral
Later is not good enough. ####<meld>anger
Ask again later. ####<meld>neutral
What the hell! ####<meld>anger
This is broken! ####<meld>anger
It-it is broken! ####<meld>anger
All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me. ####<meld>neutral
Excuse me. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah? ####<meld>neutral
Are you Phoebe Buffay? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan. ####<meld>joy
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so... ####<meld>neutral
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts. ####<meld>joy
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team. ####<meld>anger
Come on, two on one. ####<meld>neutral
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! ####<meld>surprise
What, now? ####<meld>surprise
Yes, now is when you swoop! ####<meld>joy
You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! ####<meld>joy
You're like, like the anti-Paolo! ####<meld>anger
My Catholic friend is right. ####<meld>neutral
She's distraught. ####<meld>neutral
You're there for her. ####<meld>neutral
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! ####<meld>joy
Well, I just called Joshua ####<meld>neutral
Oh, how did it go? ####<meld>sadness
Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time. ####<meld>neutral
What did he say? ####<meld>neutral
Well uh, his answering machine was ####<meld>sadness
Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care. ####<meld>sadness
I dont think hes the one Im sad about. ####<meld>sadness
Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, maybe. ####<meld>sadness
And I-I am just trying to figure out why. ####<meld>sadness
Any luck? ####<meld>sadness
Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? ####<meld>sadness
I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again. ####<meld>sadness
Again. Yknow what? I think we all did. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! ####<meld>joy
I dont get it! ####<meld>surprise
It was in my room all night! ####<meld>anger
And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did? ####<meld>anger
Shh! ####<meld>anger
Were trying to think! ####<meld>anger
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Oh yeah! ####<meld>joy
I got in there myself once. ####<meld>neutral
My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin. ####<meld>neutral
No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough. ####<meld>neutral
Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit. ####<meld>anger
All right, you have yourself a deal. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  See?! I told ya! ####<meld>surprise
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!! ####<meld>anger
Hey! Whats up? ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>joy
Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!! ####<meld>joy
Hey Joey! ####<meld>joy
Erin! Still here! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time! ####<meld>joy
Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys. ####<meld>joy
Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks! ####<meld>joy
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head. ####<meld>anger
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Ohh! ####<meld>surprise
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
I mean you definitely should do that. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what, I should do it. ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool. ####<meld>joy
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head! ####<meld>neutral
All right. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing. ####<meld>sadness
This woman's living my life. ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>surprise
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! ####<meld>anger
Look at this, look. ####<meld>anger
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. ####<meld>anger
She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. ####<meld>anger
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. ####<meld>anger
You're not an artist. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't. ####<meld>anger
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty. ####<meld>surprise
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is. ####<meld>anger
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope! ####<meld>fear
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, that is so sick. ####<meld>disgust
I feel violated. And not in a good way. ####<meld>disgust
How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots! ####<meld>surprise
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around? ####<meld>joy
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long. ####<meld>neutral
I know. My arm is killing me. ####<meld>neutral
No, I meant with the dropper over here. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm ####<meld>anger
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK. ####<meld>sadness
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box. ####<meld>sadness
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here. ####<meld>neutral
Whats the matter? ####<meld>neutral
Nothing. ####<meld>neutral
What is it? Hey! ####<meld>sadness
Really its nothing. Im just ####<meld>sadness
Rach come on, what? ####<meld>neutral
Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone. ####<meld>sadness
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross? ####<meld>surprise
Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs. ####<meld>sadness
Okay, how long was I watching that woman? ####<meld>neutral
Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right? ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I guess so. ####<meld>neutral
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh? ####<meld>sadness
Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?! ####<meld>surprise
I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand! ####<meld>joy
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six. ####<meld>anger
We said seven! ####<meld>anger
We said six! ####<meld>anger
The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!" ####<meld>anger
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Oh my good God. ####<meld>disgust
I know what time you said. ####<meld>joy
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said. ####<meld>neutral
You, get out of my shop! ####<meld>anger
Well, what did he do? ####<meld>surprise
He went out with my wife! ####<meld>anger
Joey! ####<meld>surprise
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did ####<meld>anger
Thats my wife!!! Get out! ####<meld>anger
Well, we should go. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport. ####<meld>neutral
Oh please. ####<meld>neutral
Every moment is precious. ####<meld>sadness
Yknow? ####<meld>neutral
Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving. ####<meld>sadness
Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then. ####<meld>neutral
On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane. ####<meld>sadness
No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, and I was saying the actual words. ####<meld>neutral
So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed. ####<meld>neutral
We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot. ####<meld>neutral
Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love. ####<meld>joy
Yeah? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Just go for it Chandler. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, you should. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, you should, really. ####<meld>neutral
All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys. ####<meld>neutral
: Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me. ####<meld>sadness
Come on Treeger, dont say that. ####<meld>sadness
You just ahh, you just need more practice. ####<meld>neutral
Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again. ####<meld>neutral
Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. ####<meld>sadness
I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!! ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>joy
: Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like ####<meld>neutral
July. Umm, ####<meld>neutral
Thats really beautiful. What does it mean? ####<meld>joy
Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much. ####<meld>neutral
Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave. ####<meld>neutral
Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it. ####<meld>sadness
I-I do though. ####<meld>sadness
I do too. ####<meld>sadness
Bye Phoebe. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you! ####<meld>joy
I cant believe youre getting married! ####<meld>joy
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Monica and Rachel made out. ####<meld>neutral
Ohhh! ####<meld>surprise
Why are we in bed together? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
No! ####<meld>neutral
But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we? ####<meld>fear
I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot. ####<meld>joy
And we didnt have sex. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid. ####<meld>neutral
Tell me about it. ####<meld>neutral
What are we gonna do? ####<meld>neutral
I say we go with ####<meld>neutral
Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Did she see us yet? Did she see us? ####<meld>neutral
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here? ####<meld>sadness
Whats that smell? ####<meld>disgust
I know! ####<meld>anger
Hi, remember us? ####<meld>neutral
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a ####<meld>neutral
I am. I'm ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either. ####<meld>sadness
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow what? It ####<meld>neutral
Sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Im so exited! ####<meld>joy
Ive been waiting for this for months! ####<meld>joy
I got my hair coloured! ####<meld>joy
I got new sheets! ####<meld>joy
Im making him a ####<meld>joy
What am I making him by the way? ####<meld>neutral
Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup. ####<meld>neutral
I thought I was making him filet mignon? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. ####<meld>neutral
And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke. ####<meld>anger
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook. ####<meld>surprise
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it! ####<meld>sadness
Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated. ####<meld>fear
Yknow its like uh, Biology! ####<meld>neutral
Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. ####<meld>fear
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe! ####<meld>joy
If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay. ####<meld>neutral
You are falling fast asleep. ####<meld>neutral
Deeper. ####<meld>neutral
Deeper. ####<meld>neutral
Deeper. ####<meld>neutral
You are now completely asleep. ####<meld>neutral
You dont need to smoke. ####<meld>neutral
Cigarettes dont control you. ####<meld>neutral
You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. ####<meld>neutral
A strong, confident woman. ####<meld>neutral
Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller. ####<meld>neutral
Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up. ####<meld>joy
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre? ####<meld>neutral
Of course not. ####<meld>sadness
No. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else. ####<meld>neutral
So how are things going with Paul? ####<meld>neutral
Good. ####<meld>joy
Although yknow, he-hes a private guy. ####<meld>neutral
Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings. ####<meld>sadness
Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open. ####<meld>neutral
So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table? ####<meld>surprise
No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone. ####<meld>neutral
Hi honey. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident. ####<meld>fear
Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?! ####<meld>surprise
You said number two. ####<meld>neutral
I also said number one. ####<meld>neutral
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular. ####<meld>neutral
Cant I just look at the handles on them? ####<meld>neutral
You would think. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, fine. ####<meld>neutral
Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress? ####<meld>anger
Because, I dont care. ####<meld>neutral
I dont care. ####<meld>neutral
I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do. ####<meld>anger
So I dont think I should do it anymore. ####<meld>sadness
Im gonna give you my weeks notice. ####<meld>sadness
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Gunther, I quit. ####<meld>sadness
Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee? ####<meld>surprise
Ohh, I mean its just so realistic! ####<meld>joy
I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat. ####<meld>neutral
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! ####<meld>joy
Do you uh, do youready for a refill? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining! ####<meld>surprise
Pretty cool, huh? ####<meld>joy
But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong. ####<meld>neutral
Umm, can I use your bathroom? ####<meld>neutral
Its uh, right through there. ####<meld>neutral
Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment ####<meld>joy
Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it? ####<meld>joy
You know, I think I was sixteen. ####<meld>neutral
Please, just a little bit off the back. ####<meld>neutral
I'm still on "no." ####<meld>neutral
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec? ####<meld>neutral
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again. ####<meld>anger
What's goin' on? ####<meld>neutral
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night. ####<meld>neutral
What stupid thing did you do? ####<meld>neutral
Ewww! ####<meld>disgust
I know. ####<meld>neutral
See, yes. ####<meld>neutral
Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick. ####<meld>neutral
I love you both. ####<meld>neutral
But in very different ways. ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out? ####<meld>anger
If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine! ####<meld>anger
Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too. ####<meld>fear
Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals! ####<meld>disgust
Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man. ####<meld>disgust
Thanks, Im glad you see it that way. ####<meld>joy
Ohhh-hoo, funny story! ####<meld>joy
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend? ####<meld>neutral
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him. ####<meld>neutral
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man? ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet. ####<meld>neutral
I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had! ####<meld>joy
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that? ####<meld>surprise
I might've said that.  Why is that funny? ####<meld>neutral
Because I'm very happy for him!  And ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>sadness
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? ####<meld>anger
Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out! ####<meld>disgust
Fish! ####<meld>surprise
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here ####<meld>sadness
Oh, it's so much more fun with you. ####<meld>joy
We did have fun, didn't we? ####<meld>joy
We did! ####<meld>joy
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I would love to! ####<meld>joy
Yay, okay! ####<meld>joy
Good, good, good, good, good. ####<meld>joy
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop. ####<meld>neutral
Um...  Done! ####<meld>neutral
Okay, its coffee. ####<meld>neutral
Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee! ####<meld>surprise
Its-its hot ####<meld>neutral
Hot coffee!!! ####<meld>surprise
You idiot!! ####<meld>anger
You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! ####<meld>anger
What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! ####<meld>anger
Huh? ####<meld>anger
Whats your favourite thing about summertime? ####<meld>neutral
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah ####<meld>neutral
Hey! ####<meld>surprise
Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer? ####<meld>joy
Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass. ####<meld>neutral
Ohh, thats a good one. ####<meld>joy
OK, try this salmon mousse. ####<meld>neutral
Mmmm. Good. ####<meld>joy
Is it better than the other salmon mousse? ####<meld>neutral
It's creamier. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, well, is that ####<meld>neutral
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know? ####<meld>disgust
My God! What happened to you? ####<meld>surprise
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? ####<meld>disgust
"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation." ####<meld>anger
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that! ####<meld>joy
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really ####<meld>anger
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt! ####<meld>sadness
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up. ####<meld>joy
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you. ####<meld>neutral
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket. ####<meld>neutral
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice! ####<meld>sadness
Sweetie, you think you can get in there? ####<meld>neutral
I don't see why not. ####<meld>neutral
Here's my retainer! ####<meld>neutral
Someone in there? ####<meld>neutral
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die. ####<meld>anger
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high? ####<meld>surprise
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name. ####<meld>neutral
Ginger. ####<meld>neutral
Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so.... ####<meld>neutral
Dont you have to use the bathroom? ####<meld>neutral
Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I do. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. ####<meld>neutral
Someone in here. ####<meld>neutral
Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it! ####<meld>anger
Oh yes there is! ####<meld>anger
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?! ####<meld>anger
Oh, my baby! ####<meld>sadness
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, just years of experience. ####<meld>neutral
Can I get some ice here?! ####<meld>sadness
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are. ####<meld>joy
Youre not the fan whos dying are you? ####<meld>neutral
No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma! ####<meld>joy
Oh that was a real person?! ####<meld>surprise
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me ####<meld>neutral
I-I-Im leaving the show? ####<meld>surprise
I dont know. Why? Did you hear something? ####<meld>neutral
Who told you that? ####<meld>surprise
Oh uh, one of the writers. ####<meld>sadness
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall? ####<meld>surprise
Feel better? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Much! ####<meld>joy
Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I understand. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi! ####<meld>joy
Hi! ####<meld>joy
Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere? ####<meld>surprise
I dont think so. ####<meld>neutral
Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on ####<meld>joy
Wow! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah. ####<meld>neutral
Really?! ####<meld>surprise
$4.50 please. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, let me get this.    These are for you. ####<meld>neutral
Alright, alright, alright. ####<meld>neutral
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. ####<meld>anger
Oh God, do something. ####<meld>anger
Just make contact, smile! ####<meld>anger
There you go! ####<meld>joy
You're definitely scaring here. ####<meld>neutral
Would you like to call somebody? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. ####<meld>neutral
Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not on this desk. ####<meld>anger
Oh ####<meld>neutral
Its my sister. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the ####<meld>neutral
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon? ####<meld>anger
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a ####<meld>neutral
Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, well maybe not on those levels. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Im never gonna find a roommate, ever. ####<meld>sadness
Why, nobody good? ####<meld>neutral
Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural. ####<meld>disgust
The spitter. ####<meld>disgust
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. ####<meld>anger
Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing ####<meld>neutral
So how many more do you have tomorrow? ####<meld>neutral
Two. ####<meld>neutral
This photographer, who seemed really dull. ####<meld>neutral
And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message. ####<meld>neutral
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more! ####<meld>neutral
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices. ####<meld>anger
What? ####<meld>neutral
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo... ####<meld>neutral
Umm, hows it going with you guys? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, really? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference ####<meld>joy
Hey! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
What-what are-what are these? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think? ####<meld>joy
No-no-no, no! ####<meld>fear
Well, how-how come? ####<meld>neutral
Thats just the way it is. ####<meld>neutral
Thats crazy. ####<meld>surprise
Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. ####<meld>neutral
See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter! ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Peter! ####<meld>neutral
Its me Rhonda! ####<meld>neutral
From PS-129! ####<meld>neutral
I shared my puddin which you man! ####<meld>anger
I gave you my ####<meld>neutral
I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you. ####<meld>neutral
Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he ####<meld>neutral
Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you later, Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Op, this is saved.  Gift shop. ####<meld>neutral
Hows that coffee comin, dear? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan. ####<meld>neutral
Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy. ####<meld>neutral
I know! ####<meld>joy
Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh? ####<meld>surprise
Op. ####<meld>neutral
Eh. ####<meld>joy
Oh, you got me. ####<meld>neutral
Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential. ####<meld>neutral
Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion. ####<meld>neutral
How does that sound? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, that sounds great. ####<meld>joy
Come on over here, sweetheart. ####<meld>neutral
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much. ####<meld>joy
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together? ####<meld>fear
No. But thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it? ####<meld>sadness
Okay. No. But thanks. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. ####<meld>neutral
Wow, that was kinda brutal. ####<meld>surprise
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. ####<meld>neutral
Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow. ####<meld>neutral
Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, ####<meld>neutral
Wow. ####<meld>surprise
I'm, I'm really sorry. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved. ####<meld>neutral
Relieved? ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends. ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, ####<meld>anger
Fine! ####<meld>anger
Fine! ####<meld>anger
But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility! ####<meld>anger
...I can begin to trust you again. ####<meld>anger
Does that seem like something you can do. ####<meld>anger
Does it?! ####<meld>anger
No? ####<meld>surprise
Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, I know. ####<meld>sadness
I mean, no, youre right. ####<meld>sadness
Yeah I guess Ill let it go. ####<meld>neutral
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this. ####<meld>sadness
Sure, its hard to forget! ####<meld>neutral
But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it! ####<meld>neutral
A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about. ####<meld>neutral
What the hell happened on that beach?! ####<meld>surprise
Its between us and the sea, Ross! ####<meld>neutral
I didnt think you were gay. I do now. ####<meld>joy
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up. ####<meld>neutral
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel? ####<meld>surprise
Oh, by the way, that is her full name. ####<meld>neutral
Oh wow! Im free for her! ####<meld>joy
Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free! ####<meld>surprise
Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow? ####<meld>neutral
Hold on, yknow I ####<meld>neutral
Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure! ####<meld>joy
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens. ####<meld>neutral
Well, I dont really know what that is, but ####<meld>neutral
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor. ####<meld>neutral
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay. ####<meld>disgust
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital. ####<meld>surprise
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there. ####<meld>neutral
Joey, get out of the fridge. ####<meld>anger
All right, all right. ####<meld>anger
What is that? ####<meld>surprise
For the ride. ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, like in a cab... ####<meld>neutral
Save it. ####<meld>neutral
Okay, hating this. ####<meld>disgust
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming. ####<meld>neutral

Here we go, here we go. ####<meld>neutral
Rossy, Rossy. ####<meld>neutral
WHAT IS IT?! ####<meld>anger
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality. ####<meld>joy
Yes. Absolutely. A quality. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this. ####<meld>neutral
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. ####<meld>joy
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! ####<meld>surprise
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome. ####<meld>neutral
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome. ####<meld>joy
Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana. ####<meld>sadness
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday. ####<meld>joy
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk. ####<meld>neutral
You know it? ####<meld>surprise
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, sure, they love us over there. ####<meld>neutral
Ben! Ben! Ben! ####<meld>joy
How about Joey... Pepponi? ####<meld>neutral
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. ####<meld>neutral
Joey... Switzerland? ####<meld>neutral
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. ####<meld>neutral
Which I'm not. ####<meld>neutral
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin? ####<meld>neutral
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar. ####<meld>neutral
Well, it does not ring a bell with me... ####<meld>neutral
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. ####<meld>joy
Might wanna try Joseph. ####<meld>neutral
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! ####<meld>joy
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. ####<meld>joy
Are you kidding? ####<meld>surprise
Okay, look. ####<meld>neutral
I-I studied evolution. ####<meld>joy
Remember, evolution? ####<meld>joy
Monkey into man? ####<meld>anger
Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. ####<meld>neutral
Im Doctor Monkey! ####<meld>anger
Im not arguing with that. ####<meld>neutral
All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision. ####<meld>neutral
You are both idiots. ####<meld>disgust
The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! ####<meld>disgust
You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! ####<meld>anger
Now let it go! ####<meld>anger
The joke sucks! ####<meld>anger
Its your joke. ####<meld>neutral
Is not. ####<meld>anger
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all. ####<meld>joy
I didnt! ####<meld>joy
Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. ####<meld>joy
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and ####<meld>neutral
Did you, did you ####<meld>anger
No. ####<meld>neutral
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar? ####<meld>anger
Yes! ####<meld>joy
Then don't touch one!! ####<meld>anger
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?! ####<meld>surprise
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Thanks! ####<meld>joy
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character. ####<meld>neutral
Done! ####<meld>joy
And it can't be Joey. ####<meld>neutral
It's not. ####<meld>neutral
Or Joseph. ####<meld>neutral
Oh. ####<meld>neutral
Hi! ####<meld>neutral
Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out. ####<meld>joy
Wow! Skates! ####<meld>joy
Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip? ####<meld>surprise
Well... ####<meld>neutral
Oh, whatd ya bring me?! ####<meld>joy
Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. ####<meld>joy
Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. ####<meld>joy
You want some coffee? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, sure, thatd be great. ####<meld>neutral
Regular or decaf? ####<meld>neutral
Ah, which ever is closest. ####<meld>neutral
Okay. ####<meld>neutral
So ask me what I did today. ####<meld>neutral
So what did you do today Pete? ####<meld>neutral
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef. ####<meld>joy
What?! Oh. ####<meld>surprise
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Where've you been? ####<meld>neutral
At the vet. ####<meld>neutral
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? ####<meld>fear
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. ####<meld>sadness
Hey! He beat ya. ####<meld>joy
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. ####<meld>sadness
So what does this mean? ####<meld>neutral
I'm gonna have to give him up. ####<meld>sadness
Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again! ####<meld>anger
Hang on buddy! ####<meld>anger
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this? ####<meld>surprise
I sure did. ####<meld>neutral
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. ####<meld>surprise
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? ####<meld>joy
May I come in? ####<meld>neutral
Uh, yeah, if you want too. ####<meld>neutral
Do ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, sure? ####<meld>neutral
So do I. ####<meld>neutral
Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. ####<meld>neutral
This is just about tonight. ####<meld>neutral
I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." ####<meld>neutral
I just want this to be  about what it is! ####<meld>joy
And um, what-what is that Ross? ####<meld>neutral
The physical act of love. ####<meld>joy
What?! Are you crazy? ####<meld>surprise
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness? ####<meld>surprise
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh! ####<meld>surprise
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness. ####<meld>joy
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?! ####<meld>anger
No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no. ####<meld>joy
Ah Joey. ####<meld>neutral
Joey Tribbiani. ####<meld>neutral
Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island. ####<meld>neutral
So, does that mean the audition is off? ####<meld>sadness
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination. ####<meld>neutral
What?! ####<meld>surprise
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. ####<meld>neutral
Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands! ####<meld>neutral
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. ####<meld>sadness
Have fun. ####<meld>neutral
Bye. ####<meld>neutral
Wow! Fortunately she has a ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess! ####<meld>surprise
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places! ####<meld>surprise
Hi there. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
Hi. ####<meld>neutral
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options. ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! ####<meld>neutral
So, keep having sex on a regular basis. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, DAMN IT! ####<meld>anger
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out. ####<meld>neutral
Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor. ####<meld>neutral
Ok. ####<meld>neutral
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking- ####<meld>neutral
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know. ####<meld>anger
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us! ####<meld>joy
Yeah! C'mon! ####<meld>joy
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey- ####<meld>neutral
Hi, is uh, is Carol here? ####<meld>neutral
No, she's at a faculty meeting. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... ####<meld>neutral
Come in. ####<meld>neutral
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum. ####<meld>neutral
What's it look like? ####<meld>neutral
Kinda like a big face without skin. ####<meld>neutral
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. ####<meld>neutral
Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. ####<meld>surprise
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it. ####<meld>neutral
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic. ####<meld>joy
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. ####<meld>neutral
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy? ####<meld>surprise
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there? ####<meld>joy
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it? ####<meld>surprise
I have no idea what you just said. ####<meld>neutral
Put Joey on the phone. ####<meld>neutral
What's up man? ####<meld>neutral
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth ####<meld>fear
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen. ####<meld>surprise
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind. ####<meld>neutral
and that was all before 10 oclock. ####<meld>neutral
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. ####<meld>neutral
And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips. ####<meld>neutral
Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. ####<meld>neutral
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay? ####<meld>surprise
Well, up yours too! ####<meld>anger
Wheres Chandler? ####<meld>neutral
Ah, he cant make it, he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh! ####<meld>surprise
Joey? Joey Tribbiani? ####<meld>neutral
Joey I can see you okay? Youre hiding behind the coats. ####<meld>neutral
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of. ####<meld>neutral
Well, if you dont have anything to copy, why are you going down there? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again? ####<meld>anger
Yeah! You wanna come? ####<meld>joy
Yeah! ####<meld>joy
Fine. ####<meld>neutral
Fine. ####<meld>neutral
Fine. ####<meld>neutral
All right. We're gonna go.  It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then. ####<meld>neutral
Hey. ####<meld>neutral
Whats the matter? ####<meld>sadness
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!! ####<meld>disgust
Oh Willies still alive! ####<meld>surprise
What are you guys doing? ####<meld>neutral
Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us. ####<meld>joy
Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist. ####<meld>neutral
Thats not true, there are great pictures of us! ####<meld>surprise
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this ####<meld>neutral
Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the ####<meld>surprise
I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture. ####<meld>sadness
Oh, heres a great one. ####<meld>joy
Yeah, Im not in that. ####<meld>neutral
I know, but look at me: all tan. ####<meld>joy
Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer. ####<meld>neutral
Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow ####<meld>joy
Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so stupid. ####<meld>neutral
Chandler what do you say? ####<meld>neutral
All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going. ####<meld>neutral
Gimme them! ####<meld>anger
No! They are mine! ####<meld>anger
You stole them from me! ####<meld>anger
You stole them from me!! ####<meld>anger
Gimme them! ####<meld>anger
You just wanna each take one? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them. ####<meld>neutral
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do? ####<meld>anger
Well ####<meld>neutral
Why don’t you phase it out? ####<meld>neutral
Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America. ####<meld>anger
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening! ####<meld>neutral
They’re not listening too me? ####<meld>surprise
Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you. ####<meld>neutral
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing? ####<meld>neutral
I think you look fine. ####<meld>neutral
