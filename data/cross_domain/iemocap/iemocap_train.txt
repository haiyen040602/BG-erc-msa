Excuse me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Is there a problem? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well what's the problem?  Let me change it. ####<iemocap>neutral
What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm here to get an ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Like what?  Like a birth certificate? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's out of control. ####<iemocap>angry
How long have you been working here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something? ####<iemocap>neutral
That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you have your forms? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Let me see them. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Who told you to get in this line? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This form is a Z.X.four. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  I need another ID, a separate one. ####<iemocap>frustrated
A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter? ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't... ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices. ####<iemocap>neutral
There's people that have given more though, you know? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
There's babies over there, though, that need mothers. ####<iemocap>neutral
Just, you know, kicking myself. ####<iemocap>sadness
things just aren't what they seem. ####<iemocap>sadness
If not me then, who? ####<iemocap>sadness
You'll videotape everything, yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Last month--  Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
I have to find sitters. ####<iemocap>neutral
We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street. ####<iemocap>sadness
And your mother is close by. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll send you lots of letters. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why it has to be you. ####<iemocap>sadness
What am I going to do? Huh? ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Don't you guys have access to computers over there. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't raise a baby by myself.  How? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's just not fair. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well Vegas was awesome. ####<iemocap>joy
And, um, I got married. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah.  In the old town part. ####<iemocap>joy
Um- Yes.  It was very romantic. ####<iemocap>joy
It was at the slot machines. ####<iemocap>joy
Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day. ####<iemocap>joy
But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  Totally. ####<iemocap>joy
I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now ####<iemocap>excited
He likes to keep tabs, you know. ####<iemocap>joy
Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars. ####<iemocap>neutral
Penny slots. That's what he plays. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like- ####<iemocap>joy
Fifty bucks. Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well so now we're married. We have cat children. ####<iemocap>joy
We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet. ####<iemocap>joy
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
So what's up?  What's new? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  I heard. ####<iemocap>neutral
Shut up.  No- in Vegas? ####<iemocap>neutral
Who did you marry? ####<iemocap>excited
He turned to you and was like... ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time? ####<iemocap>neutral
Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Is that your phone? ####<iemocap>joy
He loves you. ####<iemocap>joy
How much did he win at the slot? ####<iemocap>neutral
Really? Penny slots? ####<iemocap>neutral
Wow. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks. ####<iemocap>neutral
like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] Cat babies. ####<iemocap>joy
That's fair enough. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He just... ####<iemocap>neutral
you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why?  It's a piece of paper. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but... ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's baloney, that's baloney. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Please. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know, you're riding the bus, too. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why?  What choice? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're saving the environment. mmhmm ####<iemocap>frustrated
Interesting.  That's fantastic. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not frustrated. ####<iemocap>angry
Who do you think you are? ####<iemocap>angry
You are so high and mighty.  I just-- ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to. ####<iemocap>angry
The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to. ####<iemocap>angry
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice. ####<iemocap>angry
Have you tried, uh, Craig's List? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  There's regular jobs on there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh huh. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's like a manager for a theatre. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job. ####<iemocap>neutral
You did? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Hmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  Do you have a resume? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's kind of helpful when getting a job. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  But it has an outline, you know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, yeah.  I would imagine. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now. ####<iemocap>neutral
maybe get a car. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe. ####<iemocap>neutral
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>neutral
I am riding the bus, but by choice. ####<iemocap>neutral
To save the environment, carpool. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes.  One less car at a time. ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because... ####<iemocap>frustrated
...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't think I'm anyone. ####<iemocap>neutral
I- I-I didn't-- okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? Oh.  So now you're... ####<iemocap>frustrated
you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hi. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I need my bag. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nash. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Flight seven fourteen. ####<iemocap>angry
Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here? ####<iemocap>angry
Is this a joke? ####<iemocap>angry
Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline. ####<iemocap>angry
You're kidding me, this is a joke. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive. ####<iemocap>angry
We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you understand who my husband is? ####<iemocap>angry
If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here? ####<iemocap>angry
You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble. ####<iemocap>angry
Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue? ####<iemocap>angry
Because I probably know him. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't want money, I want my clothes. ####<iemocap>angry
What's your name? ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  I'll do that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet. ####<iemocap>angry
A letter? I'll make a personal phone call. ####<iemocap>angry
Hi.  Thanks for waiting. ####<iemocap>neutral
Can I help you? ####<iemocap>joy
Uh huh. ####<iemocap>joy
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue? ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh-huh. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um- ####<iemocap>neutral
we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again... ####<iemocap>neutral
for such an inconvenience and your bag, but ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no.  This is real. ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because... ####<iemocap>neutral
this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. Calm- ####<iemocap>neutral
Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really ####<iemocap>neutral
We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's a gift. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here. ####<iemocap>neutral
With the amount of-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi. ####<iemocap>neutral
Badge number?  Uh, no.  You can just take my employee number I guess. ####<iemocap>neutral
Why?  Have I done something wrong?  Have I given you bad service?  I feel like I have done the best I could. ####<iemocap>neutral
If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more... ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
That's sweet. ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago. ####<iemocap>sadness
I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city. ####<iemocap>sadness
So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know. ####<iemocap>sadness
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And- ####<iemocap>sadness
this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
At the cemetery? ####<iemocap>sadness
couple hours. ####<iemocap>sadness
I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors. ####<iemocap>sadness
My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her. ####<iemocap>sadness
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day. ####<iemocap>sadness
Umm. Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm... ####<iemocap>sadness
But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool. ####<iemocap>sadness
Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and- ####<iemocap>sadness
There's another one, I can't remember. ####<iemocap>neutral
I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know? ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm sorry, Joy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...? ####<iemocap>neutral
...pick up anything? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out. ####<iemocap>sadness
Hmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh.  She was there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
How long were you there for? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh really? ####<iemocap>neutral
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery? ####<iemocap>neutral
Is it a big cemetery? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
So she wrote a lot of poetry? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. We should throw a party. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  I'm not sure. ####<iemocap>excited
Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother. ####<iemocap>excited
I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Did you get the letter? ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah. That is so awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood? ####<iemocap>excited
This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party. ####<iemocap>excited
A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay. ####<iemocap>excited
I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  Big time. ####<iemocap>excited
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice ####<iemocap>neutral
That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question. ####<iemocap>excited
You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning. ####<iemocap>excited
Yay...School's fun. ####<iemocap>excited
Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it. ####<iemocap>joy
What's he going to say? ####<iemocap>frustrated
How could he see it?  I was the first one up; he was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's dreaming of him again, walking around. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want to do?  Argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof? ####<iemocap>frustrated
To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I got an idea, but what's your story? ####<iemocap>neutral
From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why does it have to be Annie? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want a diagram. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He thinks he's coming back Chris. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead... ####<iemocap>frustrated
...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just give it some more thought. ####<iemocap>neutral
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
You have a business here.  What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Just don't think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can see that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
He was out here when it broke. ####<iemocap>neutral
Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I guess he is. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've got to say it to him. ####<iemocap>neutral
For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>neutral
So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Then it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I wanted to get this settled first. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him. ####<iemocap>neutral
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>neutral
So what.  I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Mom, what do you want?  A diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York. ####<iemocap>neutral
I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
On this, I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then help me stay here. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know that.  Then just help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He's not going to marry her. ####<iemocap>angry
It's got that about it. ####<iemocap>angry
What is going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited. ####<iemocap>angry
Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right. ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. ####<iemocap>angry
I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>angry
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look. ####<iemocap>angry
Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe. ####<iemocap>angry
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now listen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know why she waited? ####<iemocap>neutral
Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do? What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Kate. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
You're the only one who still loves his parents. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not so bad; it's a good thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay. ####<iemocap>neutral
For one thing, your mother much as told me to go. ####<iemocap>neutral
And then, you.  You've been kind of... ####<iemocap>neutral
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew they would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come? ####<iemocap>neutral
I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
No. No ####<iemocap>joy
Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time. ####<iemocap>neutral
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>neutral
You started to write me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
beating around the bush. ####<iemocap>joy
I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me. ####<iemocap>joy
Not like that you're not. ####<iemocap>joy
Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
How many? ####<iemocap>neutral
Aw, geez. ####<iemocap>sadness
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
What would I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it? ####<iemocap>neutral
You're not sorry you came. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set. ####<iemocap>neutral
I love you. Annie, I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say. ####<iemocap>joy
Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us. ####<iemocap>joy
You felt something that far back? ####<iemocap>neutral
Why didn't you let me know? ####<iemocap>joy
Give me a... ####<iemocap>joy
Give me a kiss. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy. ####<iemocap>joy
I kissed you. ####<iemocap>joy
Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here. ####<iemocap>sadness
No it's nothing like that. It's- ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't even know how to start. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Pretty much all. ####<iemocap>sadness
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know? ####<iemocap>sadness
Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them. ####<iemocap>sadness
But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just want you to know Annie. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's not your flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours. ####<iemocap>angry
How's that supposed to make me feel? ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
I'm cold. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, then let's go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Not particularly. ####<iemocap>neutral
Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh Augie ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Is that, is that-- ####<iemocap>excited
The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Whose is it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh...well. Yeah, of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year? ####<iemocap>neutral
Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket. ####<iemocap>neutral
Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait, that's my point, too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>neutral
Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever. ####<iemocap>neutral
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested. ####<iemocap>neutral
For real? ####<iemocap>neutral
God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life? ####<iemocap>neutral
And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car. ####<iemocap>neutral
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot. ####<iemocap>neutral
We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed. ####<iemocap>excited
God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this. ####<iemocap>joy
Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming. ####<iemocap>excited
It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge. ####<iemocap>excited
So what do you think? ####<iemocap>joy
About all of that, about all I was talking about. ####<iemocap>joy
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive. ####<iemocap>angry
Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever? ####<iemocap>angry
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever. ####<iemocap>angry
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You don't understand anything I am saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is. ####<iemocap>sadness
For God's sake, this is not about fish. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married. ####<iemocap>neutral
You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be. ####<iemocap>joy
dancing barefoot in the sand. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no. Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you understand what I am saying? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know you are Augie, I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Don't be ridiculous.  Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  Don't you know that? ####<iemocap>neutral
You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself. ####<iemocap>sadness
So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, you bought refreshments. ####<iemocap>joy
I guess we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so, what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
About what I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
Not just me, look at all of these people. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then, what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They'll show up this time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. Of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sure.  All right.  Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Listen, do you want to dance? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want to take off your shoes? ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to get married again? ####<iemocap>joy
What?  What?  Do you want a divorce? ####<iemocap>neutral
No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you know what you get?  You get this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Maybe if you were with someone else, too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just- I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>neutral
And look what I got here. ####<iemocap>joy
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to go home?  Are you cold? ####<iemocap>neutral
Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come. ####<iemocap>neutral
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Is it them? ####<iemocap>neutral
Freda is the only one who knows we are here.  She wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
It had to happen sooner or later.  What are we going to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>joy
We'll behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>excited
I think I shall do a curtsy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes.  Meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious. ####<iemocap>joy
Who's they? ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Elliott, worms don't pop. ####<iemocap>joy
Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Good God. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
It must be them then. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
With perfect poise. ####<iemocap>joy
It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they? ####<iemocap>joy
Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean? ####<iemocap>joy
Who knows? ####<iemocap>joy
Yes.  Yes with all of his might. ####<iemocap>excited
Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best. ####<iemocap>joy
It was a terrible thing.  I hated it. ####<iemocap>neutral
That was a rouser, wasn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>joy
And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>joy
Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch. ####<iemocap>joy
I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't be stupid. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>angry
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man. ####<iemocap>angry
No it isn't. ####<iemocap>angry
You shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes I did, quite a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Mind your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You've always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>neutral
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio. ####<iemocap>neutral
They are away in Tunis. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  Yes I am. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad. ####<iemocap>angry
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. ####<iemocap>neutral
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What about me? ####<iemocap>angry
So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll have a little, I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Really, Amanda. ####<iemocap>angry
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you going out somewhere, dear? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder. ####<iemocap>angry
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? ####<iemocap>angry
And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow. ####<iemocap>angry
I think I am not in the least bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry

Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Oh yeah, that would be.  Well, depends on what type of car you had, though too. I guess it would be worth it. helicopter. Yeah, helicopter.  There is a helipad there, right? Yeah, exactly. ####<iemocap>joy
They do it's--believe me it's huge. ####<iemocap>joy
I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and... ####<iemocap>excited
It's pretty wild. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, well I doubt [GARBAGE] ping pong [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh you mean it's not really sport that what you're saying? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's totally a sport. What are you talking about? ####<iemocap>neutral
For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time? ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah we have like away games and stuff. ####<iemocap>neutral
But you know I'm like [GARBAGE]. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to have a mustache...On the force... ####<iemocap>joy
Pull over.. ####<iemocap>joy
What he's going to say? ####<iemocap>frustrated
When? ####<iemocap>neutral
How could he see it?  I was the first one up and he was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
What was he doing here at four in the morning? ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
Cried hard? ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>sadness
What is he doing out here at that hour? ####<iemocap>frustrated
He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean a mistake? ####<iemocap>angry
What do you want to do, argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it? ####<iemocap>angry
To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you? ####<iemocap>angry
The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so-- ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, that's only your business, Chris. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm just saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you ask Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>angry
That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. ####<iemocap>angry
He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>angry
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, must you be inspired. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, I can see that. ####<iemocap>angry
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  I figured I'd just let it wait. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess he is. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I got to. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh? ####<iemocap>angry
She is not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life... ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first. ####<iemocap>sadness
So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that. ####<iemocap>angry
If that can't happen here... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, on this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then help me stay here mom. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then help me stay. ####<iemocap>sadness
I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>angry
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why did he invite her here? ####<iemocap>angry
It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden? ####<iemocap>angry
What is going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look. ####<iemocap>angry
Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, maybe he wanted see her. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her? ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh so what? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, now listen, kids... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Listen. Line. You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And how do you know why she's waited. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do?  What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Kate... ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, calm yourself. Alright. ####<iemocap>frustrated
calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you. You're shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What the hell do you want from me, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
The only one I know still love his parents. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here. ####<iemocap>sadness
For one thing your mother as much as told me to go. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of... ####<iemocap>sadness
You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here. ####<iemocap>sadness
From her point of view why else would I come? ####<iemocap>neutral
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>neutral
Everyday since. ####<iemocap>excited
Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know. ####<iemocap>excited
I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you. ####<iemocap>joy
Chris, what's the matter? ####<iemocap>sadness
No, what is it?  Is your mother? ####<iemocap>sadness
You got to tell me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Wouldn't work like this. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>sadness
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING]. Geez. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
What would I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
You're not sorry you came? ####<iemocap>joy
Why not? ####<iemocap>sadness
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
You did? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Ann, I love you.  I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
Why didn't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
why didn't you let me know? ####<iemocap>excited
I kissed you.  I kissed Annie. ####<iemocap>excited
I kissed you. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, no, it's nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things. ####<iemocap>sadness
you know over seas I was in command of the company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Pretty much all. ####<iemocap>sadness
Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. ####<iemocap>sadness
He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today... ####<iemocap>sadness
And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument... ####<iemocap>sadness
You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all... ####<iemocap>sadness
You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again... ####<iemocap>sadness
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator. ####<iemocap>sadness
'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man... ####<iemocap>sadness
And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I want you to know Annie. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm going to make a fortune for you. ####<iemocap>joy
Ugh... ####<iemocap>frustrated
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
You keep saying "my flashlight" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel? ####<iemocap>angry
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder if they can hear me talk ####<iemocap>joy
I'm cold. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's after eleven, let's go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is no point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's my point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then let's go. ####<iemocap>angry
Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes. ####<iemocap>angry
Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions. ####<iemocap>angry
We didn't see them the year before either. ####<iemocap>angry
What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it. ####<iemocap>excited
Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good. ####<iemocap>excited
Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it-- ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right? ####<iemocap>excited
Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot? ####<iemocap>excited
Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, well, yeah of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight. ####<iemocap>neutral
Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid. ####<iemocap>excited
I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's my point too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon. ####<iemocap>frustrated
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, they do. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know. ####<iemocap>excited
It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this. ####<iemocap>excited
All right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life... ####<iemocap>frustrated
And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We just weren't in a good spot though. ####<iemocap>neutral
Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it... ####<iemocap>neutral
Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way... ####<iemocap>excited
They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction... ####<iemocap>excited
They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming... ####<iemocap>excited
Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one... ####<iemocap>excited
And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here... ####<iemocap>excited
It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind. ####<iemocap>excited
It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm. ####<iemocap>excited
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
I think it's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's a PR. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They're all told the same thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Their life will start then. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry it still just fish to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever? ####<iemocap>angry
Twice is every year we've tried that's ever. ####<iemocap>angry
No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus. ####<iemocap>angry
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married. ####<iemocap>neutral
And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to. ####<iemocap>angry
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting. ####<iemocap>angry
This isn't anything like I thought anything would be. ####<iemocap>sadness
This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that Augie, I really do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that? ####<iemocap>neutral
You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death... ####<iemocap>excited
Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so?  What do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We missed them twice. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards ####<iemocap>frustrated
and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now. ####<iemocap>frustrated
you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go." ####<iemocap>neutral
So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait a minute, I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh right sure, of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
You want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want to take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>neutral
What? Huh? ####<iemocap>neutral
You want to get married again? ####<iemocap>neutral
What?  What?  You want to divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, welcome to the human race. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No. ####<iemocap>angry
No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and-- ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know me neither. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too? ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>sadness
Look what we got here. ####<iemocap>joy
It's not champagne. ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home? ####<iemocap>neutral
Shh... ####<iemocap>joy
If we are really quiet, the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>neutral
Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
What we're going to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now and always sweet. ####<iemocap>joy
It had to happen sooner or later. ####<iemocap>joy
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>excited
Oh. Behave exquisitely... ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Mmm... ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, yes meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
[LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious. ####<iemocap>joy
Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too. ####<iemocap>joy
How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours? ####<iemocap>joy
Shall we always want to bicker and fight? ####<iemocap>joy
If one of us dies... ####<iemocap>joy
I think you're talking nonsense. ####<iemocap>joy
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
Cannes...mmhmm... ####<iemocap>joy
The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh... ####<iemocap>joy
Utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>joy
oh...[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh you knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>excited
Good God. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
We're okay, right darling?  Whatever happens, we're okay? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>joy
With perfect poise... ####<iemocap>joy
Ah... ####<iemocap>joy
Ah...Strange... ####<iemocap>joy
Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they? ####<iemocap>joy
Darling, don't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god? ####<iemocap>joy
You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want. ####<iemocap>joy
Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light. ####<iemocap>joy
We are figures of fun all right ####<iemocap>joy
Ahh...who knows. ####<iemocap>joy
Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Come here darling, kiss me ####<iemocap>excited
before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>joy
See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you remember that row we did have in Venice? ####<iemocap>joy
But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown. ####<iemocap>excited
I will never forget the look on his face. ####<iemocap>joy
oh... ####<iemocap>joy
We were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>joy
Presents? It was a trivial little broach. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
No, thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses. ####<iemocap>angry
Don't be stupid, what? ####<iemocap>angry
Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you? ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I did quite a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, mind you own business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy? ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
They are away in Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it on again, please. ####<iemocap>angry
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
I won't. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop it. No. Go away. ####<iemocap>angry
listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast. ####<iemocap>angry
I'll have a little, I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses. ####<iemocap>neutral
Really, Amanda. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are you going out somewhere dear? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder. ####<iemocap>angry
Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap. ####<iemocap>angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? ####<iemocap>angry
I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too. ####<iemocap>angry
I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how. ####<iemocap>angry
I am not in the least bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots. ####<iemocap>angry
That's a very good idea I think I will. ####<iemocap>angry
Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs. ####<iemocap>angry
Well then you'll wake the people downstairs. ####<iemocap>angry
This is no time a year for Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
I will do no such thing. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. It's driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Amanda listen. Listen. ####<iemocap>angry
That's very amusing indeed. ####<iemocap>angry
You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going like this. ####<iemocap>angry
No you're not. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration. ####<iemocap>neutral
My--my original birth certificate?  But I don't carry that with me. ####<iemocap>neutral
No it doesn't say it on the form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean if I had known--I would have brought it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time.  I mean, you've seen how long it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's lunch hour. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I can give you my social-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I can give you my Social Security Number. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well.  [BREATHING] I just--I just don't.  I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I really need this done today.  As you can see, the deadline is almost up and I can't come back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then? ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that. ####<iemocap>angry
With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else. ####<iemocap>angry
Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you have a supervisor? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hi. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Well.  We still need it. ####<iemocap>neutral
um Sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, I'm sorry but I--I can't help you.  You're gonna have to go back and uh... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right.  It's the D.M.V.. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright, I don't know what to tell you right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I make an exception for you and I have to make an exception for everyone.  I mean, I-I've seen this before and I know it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do. You just have to- ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, it's-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting ####<iemocap>angry
I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know, Official documentation-- ####<iemocap>angry
No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am the supervisor.  So-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's almost time for me to go. ####<iemocap>sadness
There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know-- ####<iemocap>sadness
You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't think so. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile. ####<iemocap>sadness
You could send me pictures. ####<iemocap>sadness
Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all-- ####<iemocap>sadness
and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and-- ####<iemocap>sadness
You can just remember it for me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger. ####<iemocap>sadness
I have no choice. There's nothing I can do. ####<iemocap>sadness
What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here.  Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, come on.  You've gotta think of something.  A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart.  I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it.  I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words.  For her first steps.  I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh my God.  Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what? ####<iemocap>excited

It is good.  It's totally good.  I mean, it like oh, you know. ####<iemocap>excited

Well--can--I mean, let me know--I want- I want invitations and-- ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, yes.  This is the whole [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>excited
It'll be good.  Wow, that's great. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again.  Like-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's.  Like, I don't-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like, it just takes it out of you-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I feel so worthless. ####<iemocap>sadness
And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Or they'll never talk to me again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but ####<iemocap>frustrated
you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning. ####<iemocap>sadness
So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything? ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't ####<iemocap>neutral
No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive. ####<iemocap>neutral
There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot... ####<iemocap>neutral
...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and... ####<iemocap>neutral
... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know ####<iemocap>neutral
Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>frustrated
That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you've gotta live. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Some problems?  What is that supposed to mean? ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you lose a suitcase?  A huge suitcase? ####<iemocap>neutral
How much? ####<iemocap>neutral
Fifty dollars?  For my suitcase?  I mean, the suitcase itself was like a hundred and fifty dollar just for the suitcase, but all the things inside, all my clothes, all my personal belongings, the sentimental value, not to mention, which is more-more than all of that together. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff? ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because you don't seem to care very much, you know. ####<iemocap>angry
I didn't sign anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Isn't there anything else you can do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
There needs to be better security here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Thank you very much. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh- ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do. ####<iemocap>neutral
I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um ####<iemocap>neutral
By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the-- ####<iemocap>neutral
You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you ####<iemocap>neutral
probably even talk to-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh ####<iemocap>neutral
but Unfortunately sometimes is-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, that's--that's what I'm saying-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, Johnny died yesterday. ####<iemocap>sadness
We knew that it was coming, but-- ####<iemocap>sadness
It seemed like he had a little bit longer.  Like just last week, he was doing was so well. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just don't want him to be gone. ####<iemocap>sadness
And his whole family was there. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know ####<iemocap>sadness
He was so young, you know.  And all the stories he used to tell me about... ####<iemocap>sadness
...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna-- ####<iemocap>sadness
Nobody's ever gonna forget him. ####<iemocap>sadness
He did a lot.  But-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm gonna forget him. ####<iemocap>sadness
I won't be able to hear his voice or his-- ####<iemocap>sadness
You start to lose like that image after a while. ####<iemocap>sadness
Thanks. ####<iemocap>sadness
Hey, a what's up? ####<iemocap>neutral
Wow, that's horrible. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry to hear about that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean--I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than... ####<iemocap>neutral
.than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, exactly.  He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and ####<iemocap>neutral
And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but-- ####<iemocap>neutral
But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and-- ####<iemocap>neutral
No, you'll never forget him. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside-- ####<iemocap>neutral
That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so . ####<iemocap>neutral
It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now. ####<iemocap>neutral
I got into U.S.C. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say-- ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway. ####<iemocap>excited
So-- ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I know. ####<iemocap>excited
Absolutely. I'm so excited. ####<iemocap>excited
I know.  I know. And we'll all get to hang out.  And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like... ####<iemocap>excited
...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school ####<iemocap>excited
and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like... ####<iemocap>excited
You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C. ####<iemocap>excited
And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you... ####<iemocap>excited
...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean? ####<iemocap>excited
Like it has some prestige. so ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine-- ####<iemocap>excited
Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know-- ####<iemocap>excited
Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know ####<iemocap>excited
I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, oh totally.  It's a beautiful campus.  It's gonna be really nice.  Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls.  Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate. ####<iemocap>excited
You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first... ####<iemocap>excited
...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean? ####<iemocap>excited
So, um, so I don't know. ####<iemocap>excited
I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see. ####<iemocap>excited
I- They have like--they just have so many like prestigious like this school is top ten and like the departments within it, you know what I mean. ####<iemocap>excited
I know, I get to be one of those now--I'll like walk around and be like a U.S.C..  You know what I mean. ####<iemocap>excited
And you'll be like... ####<iemocap>excited
Student. I'm a student. Yes I am, Thank you very much. ####<iemocap>excited
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>excited
I know.  I'm excited. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>excited
That's going to be a lot of work. ####<iemocap>excited
But, it'll be fine, I mean.  I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun. ####<iemocap>excited
I know, and I mean the area's not great, but like the school makes up for it. It'll be fine. It'll be good. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. I know. So fun.  I can't wait. ####<iemocap>excited
I will. I will. Thank you. ####<iemocap>excited
Thanks. ####<iemocap>excited
So, how's it going? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, you got what?  Where? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, no way. ####<iemocap>excited
Are you gonna go? you gonna- ####<iemocap>excited
Wow, that's... ####<iemocap>excited
...that's first choice, huh? That's so awesome and now look you're gonna be--you're gonna be here. you know ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna.. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah ####<iemocap>excited
Fight on. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Wow. That's cool. ####<iemocap>excited
So... ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Right.  Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess. ####<iemocap>excited
That'll be awesome. ####<iemocap>joy
I mean because you went to the campus before, right? ####<iemocap>joy
Oh man. ####<iemocap>excited
Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE] ####<iemocap>excited
You'll be like are you a fan or a student you know? Student. [LAUGHTER] Oh man, that's awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set. ####<iemocap>excited
You're getting close to the beach.  I mean geez. ####<iemocap>excited
Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
All right, sir. ####<iemocap>neutral
I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time. ####<iemocap>neutral
I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous, ####<iemocap>neutral
um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here. ####<iemocap>neutral
Is that all right? ####<iemocap>neutral
I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end. ####<iemocap>neutral
All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So- ####<iemocap>neutral
um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely. we we ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves. ####<iemocap>neutral
So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Great.  How many seats? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like? ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that. ####<iemocap>neutral
So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare. ####<iemocap>neutral
And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again. ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, hello. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, I'm sorry.  It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and- ####<iemocap>frustrated
You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] that's good. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. So-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a ####<iemocap>neutral
--you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, it's gonna be four of them. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  And can they like all get together? ####<iemocap>neutral
Um- You know, window is nice. I guess ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know-- ####<iemocap>neutral
And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
He cried hard? ####<iemocap>sadness
What was he doing out here at that hour? ####<iemocap>sadness
What do you want to do argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can you prove it?  How can you prove it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've got an idea, but what's the story? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, that's only your business, Chris. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm just saying that-- ####<iemocap>neutral
From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that. ####<iemocap>neutral
[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does. ####<iemocap>neutral
Trouble is, you don't see enough women. ####<iemocap>sadness
You never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just--give it some more thought. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
What about the business?  What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can see that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now? ####<iemocap>angry
We've got to say it to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane. ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm gonna ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not only my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's all right then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, then it isn't just my business-- ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Because it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  All right, then, Mom. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it. ####<iemocap>angry
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, on this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am thinkin' that way. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>neutral
-he's not gonna marry her. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's got that all about it. ####<iemocap>angry
Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited. ####<iemocap>frustrated
She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but... ####<iemocap>angry
But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it. ####<iemocap>angry
Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You, above all, have to believe. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just--just don't stop believing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again? ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know he's even thinking of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, so what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now, listen Kate. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know why she's waited? ####<iemocap>neutral
Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, what do you want me to do about it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But Kate-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  All right.  Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What does that mean?  Me above all? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you.  Look at you shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
from her point of view, why else would I come? ####<iemocap>sadness
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>joy
You started to write me and-- ####<iemocap>joy
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you. ####<iemocap>joy
Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed. ####<iemocap>sadness
You've gotta tell me. ####<iemocap>sadness
It wouldn't work this way. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>sadness
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, gee. ####<iemocap>sadness
You still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
What'll I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
You're not sorry you came? ####<iemocap>neutral
You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  Nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know how to start. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's after eleven, let's just go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ah, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight. ####<iemocap>excited
This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better. ####<iemocap>excited
I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it. ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think? ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, well sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember? ####<iemocap>neutral
You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket. ####<iemocap>neutral
This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now. ####<iemocap>excited
I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped. ####<iemocap>excited
You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's my point too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean, ####<iemocap>excited
this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life. ####<iemocap>neutral
We weren't in a good spot. ####<iemocap>neutral
There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this. ####<iemocap>excited
all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters. ####<iemocap>excited
It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name. ####<iemocap>excited
They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death. ####<iemocap>excited
Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so what do you think? ####<iemocap>neutral
What I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married. ####<iemocap>sadness
I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork. ####<iemocap>sadness
And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that, Augie.  Really, I do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
Augie, you brought refreshments. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, then we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, so what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
What I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people. ####<iemocap>neutral
Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home. ####<iemocap>neutral
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice.  That's not ever. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, we'll see them this year. ####<iemocap>neutral
I thought you wanted to see it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky." ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait a minute.  I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance? ####<iemocap>neutral
You want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You wanna get married again? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What?  What?  You want a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish? ####<iemocap>angry
No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us ####<iemocap>sadness
'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know, me neither. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, look what we have here. ####<iemocap>joy
It's not champagne. ####<iemocap>joy
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you think it's them? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
What're we gonna do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Ah, it send shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy. ####<iemocap>joy
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. ####<iemocap>joy
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, meaning just that. ####<iemocap>joy
Who's they? ####<iemocap>neutral
If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, dear, shall we like that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh? ####<iemocap>neutral
Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense. ####<iemocap>joy
Elliott, worms don't pop. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you. ####<iemocap>joy
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>joy
Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. ####<iemocap>joy
It went in intermittently for days. ####<iemocap>joy
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. ####<iemocap>joy
That was the first time you ever hit me. ####<iemocap>neutral
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. ####<iemocap>joy
It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous. ####<iemocap>excited
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number. ####<iemocap>neutral
With the most perfect poise? ####<iemocap>neutral
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, darling, don't say that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love? ####<iemocap>neutral
You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want. ####<iemocap>neutral
All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths. ####<iemocap>neutral
Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light. ####<iemocap>neutral
Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright. ####<iemocap>neutral
Who knows. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion. ####<iemocap>neutral
Depends on how well we've played. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes.  Yes. With all his might. ####<iemocap>excited
No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors. ####<iemocap>excited
So is everyone else in the long run. ####<iemocap>neutral
Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment. ####<iemocap>excited
Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best. ####<iemocap>neutral
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice? ####<iemocap>neutral
The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
How long did that row last? ####<iemocap>neutral
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown. ####<iemocap>neutral
I didn't hit you very hard. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, I'll never forget his face. ####<iemocap>excited
We were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>neutral
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, it's become a habit with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't be so stupid. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>angry
A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you? ####<iemocap>excited
No, it isn't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, be quiet. ####<iemocap>angry
Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Adders don't snap, they sting. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Mind your own business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're quite insufferable ####<iemocap>angry
I expect it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>frustrated
On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Turn it on again, please. ####<iemocap>angry
Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh Yes, I am. ####<iemocap>angry
I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. ####<iemocap>angry
Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it. ####<iemocap>angry
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. ####<iemocap>neutral
What of it? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, what about me? ####<iemocap>angry
Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy? ####<iemocap>neutral
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment. ####<iemocap>angry
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They snap. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not in the least drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots. ####<iemocap>angry
Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There are people downstairs I suppose? ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is no time of the year for Tunis. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll do no such thing. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Amanda, listen. listen ####<iemocap>angry
Very amusing, indeed. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going like this. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry-- ####<iemocap>angry
I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees ####<iemocap>angry
You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
Hi, How can I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Sure, um ####<iemocap>neutral
do you have two forms of ID with you? ####<iemocap>neutral
I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well ####<iemocap>neutral
I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I'm sorry sir but ####<iemocap>frustrated
you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, it's actually- ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry, sir. ####<iemocap>neutral
there is nothing I can do. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know sir, but we have to have two forms. There is nothing I can do about it, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said. ####<iemocap>frustrated
If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, maybe you should ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry, sir, it's not my choice. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. Finally. Here you go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yea. I just want to get this done, ####<iemocap>neutral
get my new license. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, no, I got my driver's license though. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to - ####<iemocap>neutral
well is the dri-driver's license going to work? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, so what are you saying? What- ####<iemocap>frustrated
What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after ####<iemocap>angry
three hours and ####<iemocap>angry
Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again? ####<iemocap>angry
It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my ####<iemocap>angry
I filled out the application right, didn't I? ####<iemocap>angry
Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've been waiting for three hours. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is ridiculous. Come on ####<iemocap>frustrated
I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean- ####<iemocap>frustrated
That doesn't make any sense. Why? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application ####<iemocap>angry
What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home. ####<iemocap>angry
I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
God, oh my- ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want you to go. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't want to be a single mom. ####<iemocap>sadness
but ####<iemocap>sadness
It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll ####<iemocap>sadness
I hope so. ####<iemocap>sadness
I hope so. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's going to be really rough. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'll send you lots of pictures. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, just promise me that you going to be safe. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get ####<iemocap>sadness
It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Will you write me letters, paper ones? ####<iemocap>sadness
Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'll miss you too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot. ####<iemocap>sadness
You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and ####<iemocap>sadness
and ####<iemocap>sadness
It's- It's dangerous anywhere, honey. I mean this is -this- I'm just going to go and we'll get it over with, ####<iemocap>frustrated
You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright? ####<iemocap>sadness
I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year. ####<iemocap>sadness
there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country ####<iemocap>sadness
and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back ####<iemocap>neutral
Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon. ####<iemocap>sadness
I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you. ####<iemocap>sadness
What? What? You look really happy what's going on? ####<iemocap>excited
Finally did what? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did ####<iemocap>excited
Did she say yes? ####<iemocap>excited
That's like the most definitive. ####<iemocap>excited
I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this. ####<iemocap>excited
Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, You did not. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute ####<iemocap>excited
That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God. ####<iemocap>excited
She must have flipped out. ####<iemocap>excited
Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Did you bring her up on stage too? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute. ####<iemocap>excited
Are your parents excited or...? ####<iemocap>excited
Ooh, that would be fun. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool. ####<iemocap>excited
Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, you're never going to believe it. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, I finally did it ####<iemocap>excited
Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know ####<iemocap>excited
Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know ####<iemocap>excited
I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah ####<iemocap>joy
so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and- ####<iemocap>joy
I-I did. ####<iemocap>joy
I know, so ####<iemocap>joy
I got to freak her out. ####<iemocap>joy
No, yes -- so ####<iemocap>excited
Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no. ####<iemocap>joy
No, but it was good. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean... ####<iemocap>joy
Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first ####<iemocap>excited
I know. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand. ####<iemocap>joy
Sure. Oh, yes. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah ####<iemocap>excited
Hah. ####<iemocap>joy
So how you feeling? ####<iemocap>neutral
You've been doing a lot of work for it, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is - ####<iemocap>neutral
you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, but you care about what you do, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself. ####<iemocap>neutral
You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like ####<iemocap>neutral
and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control. ####<iemocap>neutral
So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering. ####<iemocap>neutral
But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop. ####<iemocap>neutral
Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uhm, I don't know ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean ####<iemocap>frustrated
I have got to get a job, you know? Like- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know, I mean why - why ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking ####<iemocap>sadness
maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't ####<iemocap>frustrated
this doesn't happen to a normal person. ####<iemocap>angry
I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. Thanks for talking to me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Hi, can I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. Well, um- the f. ####<iemocap>neutral
Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something. ####<iemocap>neutral
I- I- I understand, but um. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do- ####<iemocap>neutral
Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and ####<iemocap>neutral
they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that. ####<iemocap>neutral
So we'll- what we'll do ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, so. ####<iemocap>neutral
We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage. ####<iemocap>neutral
I understand, so- ####<iemocap>neutral
all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage ####<iemocap>neutral
and we will continue to look for it and because your paper- ####<iemocap>neutral
I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than- ####<iemocap>neutral
The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have ####<iemocap>neutral
we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely- ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can- ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's other people waiting- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hi. Um- ####<iemocap>neutral
It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know ####<iemocap>neutral
For some reason, so you think it won't show up? ####<iemocap>neutral
I really - I really need that bag. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there ####<iemocap>frustrated
Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane ####<iemocap>frustrated
can they check there? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and ####<iemocap>angry
see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with- ####<iemocap>angry
This is unbelievable. I've got ####<iemocap>frustrated
you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay ####<iemocap>angry
so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do ####<iemocap>frustrated
I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage] ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on ####<iemocap>frustrated
that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean- ####<iemocap>angry
I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do ####<iemocap>angry
because this is ridiculous? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
It doesn't make any easier, yes. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, man. I'm so sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Totally. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories. ####<iemocap>sadness
She really cared about you, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
And she was ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there. ####<iemocap>sadness
Are you going to be okay? ####<iemocap>sadness
It's going to be okay, I promise. ####<iemocap>sadness
Sure ####<iemocap>sadness
you shouldn't be alone ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes. ####<iemocap>sadness
Kathy died last night. ####<iemocap>sadness
yeah, I mean, you know, it was a - ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore, ####<iemocap>sadness
She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but ####<iemocap>sadness
God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go ####<iemocap>sadness
out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know ####<iemocap>sadness
not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean. ####<iemocap>sadness
She was [garbage] ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great ####<iemocap>sadness
so loving everybody you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go. ####<iemocap>sadness
We were all going take a trip to Europe you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes.  [BREATHING] God. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it ####<iemocap>sadness
just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then she's gone. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps ####<iemocap>sadness
to talk to somebody but ####<iemocap>sadness

Hi. Thank you so much, you're a real person, right, you're not like a recording? ####<iemocap>excited
Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the- ####<iemocap>excited
it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there. ####<iemocap>excited
So is there any way to like bypass that because that is so, like I've been going around in circles ####<iemocap>frustrated
like press nine, press zero, press back to the menu, like I can't get through to what I'm supposed to get through to. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. Oh, that would just make it so much better, 'cause I cannot handle it's just like oh, my God I can't sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you very much. Um  So I have a charge on my credit card that, um, isn't mine. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, I don't know where it came from and it's actually quite large, and I don't have the money for it so ####<iemocap>neutral
it really freaks me out when I got my bill because it was like I don't -- I didn't spend this. This is not my charge. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something ####<iemocap>neutral
and it was like something like eight hundred dollars. I don't remember. It was just a lot and I have thing in front of me right now, but- ####<iemocap>frustrated
'Cause I-I just don't know how someone could have gotten my charge information ####<iemocap>frustrated
So is there any- I mean what if they spend something again? ####<iemocap>neutral
I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might- ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, really? ####<iemocap>neutral
Great. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah. ####<iemocap>joy
Right, right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, great. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, totally. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well thank you so much. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it. ####<iemocap>joy
Thank you very much bye. ####<iemocap>joy
All right. Customer service this is Steve. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating. ####<iemocap>neutral
I- I'll give you a little hint, next time if it asks if you're on a rotary phone you know, just stay on the line instead of - instead of hitting one or two to say if you're like on a touch tone ####<iemocap>neutral
pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know they don't tell you that kind of thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, Alright, yeah. I- I see it on here. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right. Well, you know that's, that's what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean it's ####<iemocap>neutral
it- it'll work out fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
So- So you can um find that application. You have the Internet, you can go to our website. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. Yeah. You get the form right now. and- yeah ####<iemocap>neutral
We could mail it to you as well, but- ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and- ####<iemocap>neutral
and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. I mean we might ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave- ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so ####<iemocap>neutral
so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh- ####<iemocap>neutral
it's a different number and everything ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And ####<iemocap>neutral
And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um ####<iemocap>neutral
if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and ####<iemocap>neutral
and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but- ####<iemocap>neutral
you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright. ####<iemocap>neutral
Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want to do, argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can you prove it, how can you prove it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I got an idea but what's the story? ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't- ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm just saying ####<iemocap>frustrated
From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does. ####<iemocap>neutral
Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did. ####<iemocap>angry
I just don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>angry
That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
What the hell is this, are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
What about the business? What is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
Tell me, you'd leave the business? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
Just don't go thinking that way. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yea, I can see that. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. I figured it was best to leave him alone. ####<iemocap>sadness
I could hear him right through the floor in my room. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've got to say it to him. ####<iemocap>angry
For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane. ####<iemocap>angry
All right. All right. Listen to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know why I brought Annie here don't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
No it's not only my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
See it isn't just my business- ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time. ####<iemocap>angry
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
I wanted to get this settled first. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>sadness
So what I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York. ####<iemocap>sadness
I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it. ####<iemocap>angry
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, on this I would. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I am thinking that way. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why did he invite her here? ####<iemocap>angry
She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden- ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. ####<iemocap>angry
He's not going to marry her. ####<iemocap>angry
What's going on here Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited. ####<iemocap>frustrated
She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense ####<iemocap>angry
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but ####<iemocap>frustrated
I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone. ####<iemocap>sadness
Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just you above all need to believe. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't stop believing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know he's even thinking of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, so what? ####<iemocap>neutral
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know why she has waited? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do about it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But Kate ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. All right. Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What does that mean, me above all? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you -- look at you shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate? ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's all right.  It's a good thing. ####<iemocap>joy
You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet. ####<iemocap>joy
No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay. ####<iemocap>joy
I knew they would, your mother anyway. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, from her point of view, why else would I come? ####<iemocap>neutral
I guess this is why I came. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, you started to write me ####<iemocap>joy
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed. ####<iemocap>sadness
It wouldn't work this way. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that. ####<iemocap>sadness
What'll I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
I know, it went out of style, didn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other. ####<iemocap>excited
Why didn't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
You felt something that far back? ####<iemocap>excited
Ann, why didn't you let me know? ####<iemocap>excited
Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  Nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean? ####<iemocap>sadness
To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him. ####<iemocap>sadness
Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I want you now Annie. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's not your flashlight. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's ours; it's mine too. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yea. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm cold. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's after eleven. Let's just go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is no point in coming down here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's my point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So let's go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Not particularly. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't, it's just stupid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Augie ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just not. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes. ####<iemocap>neutral
Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions. ####<iemocap>angry
We didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight. ####<iemocap>excited
God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better. ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell. ####<iemocap>excited
Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think? ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid? ####<iemocap>excited
You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Who's is it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget, ####<iemocap>excited
oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped. ####<iemocap>excited
You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? ####<iemocap>excited
Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>neutral
Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year. ####<iemocap>excited
Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that. ####<iemocap>excited
This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs ####<iemocap>excited
you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested. ####<iemocap>excited
For real? ####<iemocap>neutral
And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen. ####<iemocap>excited
Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way, ####<iemocap>excited
they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation. ####<iemocap>excited
Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters. ####<iemocap>excited
It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question, ####<iemocap>excited
they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death. ####<iemocap>excited
Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up. ####<iemocap>excited
It's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We never do, do we? I mean have we ever? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus, ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is. ####<iemocap>angry
For heavens sake this isn't about fish. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married. ####<iemocap>sadness
We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork. ####<iemocap>sadness
And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them ####<iemocap>sadness
and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be ####<iemocap>sadness
Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that? ####<iemocap>joy
You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I guess we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Hmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
So what do you think? ####<iemocap>neutral
What I was saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>neutral
Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice; that's not ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, we'll see them this year. ####<iemocap>neutral
I thought you wanted to see them. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said ####<iemocap>neutral
"the Grunion are running tonight," I said "great, let's go, I feel lucky," ####<iemocap>neutral
okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage- ####<iemocap>neutral
It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right? ####<iemocap>excited
Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right? ####<iemocap>excited
Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance? ####<iemocap>neutral
You want to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>neutral
Get married again? ####<iemocap>neutral
What? What? You want a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish? ####<iemocap>angry
No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us ####<iemocap>frustrated
'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I know. Me neither. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you were with somebody else too. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Now that you mention it. No, I don't. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here. ####<iemocap>joy
What have we got here? ####<iemocap>joy
Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
What are we going to do? ####<iemocap>excited
Now and always sweet. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh. It sends shivers down my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey. ####<iemocap>joy
Who's they? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh dear, should we like that? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh? ####<iemocap>neutral
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>joy
Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>joy
I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. ####<iemocap>joy
It went on intermittently for days. ####<iemocap>joy
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. ####<iemocap>joy
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous. ####<iemocap>joy
And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Good God. ####<iemocap>neutral
Must be them then. ####<iemocap>neutral
We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens? ####<iemocap>neutral
Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number. ####<iemocap>excited
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us? ####<iemocap>neutral
With the most perfect poise. ####<iemocap>joy
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they? ####<iemocap>joy
Oh darling don't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love? ####<iemocap>joy
What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean? ####<iemocap>joy
You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want. ####<iemocap>excited
flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light. ####<iemocap>excited
Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right. ####<iemocap>excited
No, that desire will fade along with our passion. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes, yes, with all his might. ####<iemocap>excited
No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors. ####<iemocap>excited
So is everyone else in the long run. ####<iemocap>excited
Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. ####<iemocap>excited
Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>excited
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice? ####<iemocap>joy
That was a rouser, wasn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
I'll never forget his face. ####<iemocap>joy
You knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>excited
Presents, just a trivial little broach. ####<iemocap>excited
No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often. ####<iemocap>neutral
No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. ####<iemocap>neutral
What of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm bored of this conversation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No thanks. ####<iemocap>neutral
It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, it's become a habit with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>angry
No I'm just making myself fascinating for you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, no it isn't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Be quiet. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I did quite a lot. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh be quiet. ####<iemocap>angry
Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop it. Stop it. I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh yes I am. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it. ####<iemocap>angry
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him. ####<iemocap>angry
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>angry
You let him kiss you; you said you did. ####<iemocap>angry
What about me? ####<iemocap>angry
I have a little I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on. ####<iemocap>neutral
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Going out somewhere, dear? ####<iemocap>neutral
As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true. ####<iemocap>neutral
Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They snap. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? ####<iemocap>neutral
What riotous time you must have had. ####<iemocap>angry
No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow. ####<iemocap>angry
We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots. ####<iemocap>angry
All right. I will. ####<iemocap>neutral
Better turn that off I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll do no such thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Amanda, listen. Listen. ####<iemocap>angry
Very amusing indeed. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going like this. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
What's wrong? ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no, no, no, no, no. The lady over there, she told me to fill out the front and she said to wait in this line. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know. Some lady. Sonya or something. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Excuse me? No, no. I waited in the line over there.. ####<iemocap>frustrated
and she told me to come over here and she said to fill out everything on the application and I did that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, I-- No, no, no, I--you don't understand. I have to go back to work. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am not- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But you don't understand. I cannot get back in line because I have to go back to work. I will get fired if I don't leave here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, um- ####<iemocap>neutral
You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Who? ####<iemocap>neutral
She- she probably doesn't even work here. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right  Uh- ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You just take--all right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, you didn't fill this paper at work out right and it's going to take another fifteen minutes to do it and look at how long the line we got here so just- ####<iemocap>frustrated
okay, just go back and fill it out real quick and I'm sorry, you have to get back in line and wait. I can't let you cut. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How's it going, babe? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral

I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything. ####<iemocap>sadness
I have no money behind me. Nothing. I'm twenty five and-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
So I'll have to wait twenty five years- ####<iemocap>frustrated
-just going and auditioning and auditioning and rejection after refection, it's like-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, I just don't know if I can handle it. I mean, you're helping me so much financially it's like I can't survive on my own without you. I don't like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I feel like I'm not doing anything. Like I'm not giving anything into this world. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, but what if I never make it? What if I studied all my life, this theatre, this acting, and I'm never going to get anywhere. I'm never going to be able to have a job. ####<iemocap>frustrated

Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air? ####<iemocap>angry
Okay. All I know is that I am supposed to have my language here right now. Right now. And it's not there. And you're supposed to help me because you work at the airport. So give me my luggage or tell me where the hell it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated

I'm sorry, Mrs. Rosenkrantz, but uh- I don't know what to tell you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Did you- Did you check with the lost and found? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Maybe it got lost. Did you think about that, mom? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, I mean, maybe in the little--going around thingy thing where bopper stole it from there. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. What can we do is we can get your name and information and if it shows up we can send it to you so-- Wherever you stay ####<iemocap>frustrated

Up to a limit of twenty five dollars. ####<iemocap>neutral
Whoa, maybe you should uh- have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag, hmm? Did you think about that? ####<iemocap>frustrated

He was amazing. ####<iemocap>sadness
I loved that boy. ####<iemocap>sadness
We did everything together, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone. ####<iemocap>sadness
He's so young. It seems so-- ####<iemocap>sadness
so wrong in so many ways. ####<iemocap>sadness
His poor parents. You know, it's their only son. ####<iemocap>sadness
Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease. ####<iemocap>sadness

He was like, he was like my brother, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
He was my brother. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just seems so unfair, is the way it is. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know, he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and- ####<iemocap>sadness
Kelly. Kelly Uveny. ####<iemocap>sadness
They talked about getting married and-- ####<iemocap>sadness

You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand why it has to be her. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I don't want a diagram. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, you have to be inspired. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Tell me something. ####<iemocap>neutral
You'd leave that business. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can't do that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm going to. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know you, do I? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. I can see that. ####<iemocap>neutral
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
He was out there when it happened. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone. ####<iemocap>neutral
I could hear it right through the floor. ####<iemocap>neutral
I guess he is. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad. ####<iemocap>neutral
Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We got to tell him that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. All right. Just come on, sit down. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I want to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Come on, you know that's not only my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it. ####<iemocap>neutral
See, then it's not just my business. God, you have ####<iemocap>angry
-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit. ####<iemocap>angry
Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time. ####<iemocap>sadness
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
I didn't ask Annie yet. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wanted to get this settled first. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mom, don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So what? I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just- ####<iemocap>frustrated
It just is. I- ####<iemocap>neutral
I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. All right, then. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I've given it three years of thought. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But if I can't have that here then I'll get out. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York. ####<iemocap>neutral
The business. The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to. ####<iemocap>angry
Now, Annie's in the middle of all that. ####<iemocap>angry
Now, where do I find it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes. On this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then help me stay here. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. Just- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>neutral
Why did you invite her here? ####<iemocap>angry
She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and- ####<iemocap>angry
You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see. ####<iemocap>angry
It's got that about it. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. She knows that. ####<iemocap>angry
She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her- ####<iemocap>sadness
Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother. ####<iemocap>angry
Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me. ####<iemocap>angry
Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe. ####<iemocap>angry
No, you've got to believe. ####<iemocap>sadness
You got to keep believing. ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, so what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Listen, kid- ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know why she's waited? ####<iemocap>neutral
Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for? ####<iemocap>neutral
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>neutral
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right. All right. Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay. Just calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why me, above all? ####<iemocap>angry
Huh? ####<iemocap>angry
Why me above all? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you, you're shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What have I got to hide? ####<iemocap>angry
Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
You're the only one I know that still loves his parents. ####<iemocap>joy
No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know. ####<iemocap>joy
It's really lovely here. The air is sweet. ####<iemocap>joy
No. I'm not sorry. It's- ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER]. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I mean, ####<iemocap>joy
from her opinion, why else would I come here? ####<iemocap>joy
Well, I guess that's why I came. ####<iemocap>joy
I've been ready for a long, long time. ####<iemocap>joy
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you. ####<iemocap>joy
Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris. ####<iemocap>joy
No. What is it? Is it your mother? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed. ####<iemocap>sadness
You should tell me. ####<iemocap>sadness
But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>sadness
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
Geez. ####<iemocap>sadness
And you still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too. ####<iemocap>sadness
What am I going to do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
You're not sorry you came? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well- ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set. ####<iemocap>joy
I, I guess that's why I asked you to come. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, Annie. ####<iemocap>joy
Annie, I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
I love you a great deal. ####<iemocap>joy
I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me. ####<iemocap>joy
Why didn't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
You felt something that far back? ####<iemocap>joy
Why didn't you let me know? ####<iemocap>joy
Give me a kiss, Annie. ####<iemocap>joy
Give me- ####<iemocap>joy
We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy. ####<iemocap>joy
I kissed you. ####<iemocap>joy
Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, no, no, no. Nothing like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know where to start. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I, and I thought something watching them go down. ####<iemocap>sadness
Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me? ####<iemocap>sadness
And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I didn't want to take any of it. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
Annie, ####<iemocap>joy
Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you. ####<iemocap>joy
Fine. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel? ####<iemocap>angry
Not particularly. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. I just don't. ####<iemocap>sadness
Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, God, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Look at the night we got; couldn't be better. ####<iemocap>excited
You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight. ####<iemocap>excited
Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there? ####<iemocap>excited
We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it. ####<iemocap>excited
I hope the moon stays out. ####<iemocap>excited
Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember? ####<iemocap>excited
We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket. ####<iemocap>excited
You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER]. ####<iemocap>excited
I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>neutral
What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home? ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, that's my point too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave. ####<iemocap>excited
I mean, don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Why not? ####<iemocap>neutral
For real? ####<iemocap>neutral
We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute. ####<iemocap>excited
And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters. ####<iemocap>excited
You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one. ####<iemocap>excited
its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name. ####<iemocap>excited
They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here ####<iemocap>excited
where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up. ####<iemocap>excited
About what I just said. ####<iemocap>neutral
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up. ####<iemocap>angry
I do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you remember the last time we came here? ####<iemocap>sadness
We thought I was pregnant. ####<iemocap>sadness
You brought a bottle of champagne. ####<iemocap>sadness
We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon. ####<iemocap>joy
And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, that moment-that was it. ####<iemocap>joy
I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't want to remember something. ####<iemocap>sadness
Hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, no. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>angry
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This what? What is this? This is nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting. ####<iemocap>angry
Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be. ####<iemocap>sadness
it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person. ####<iemocap>joy
I noticed that. It's beautiful. ####<iemocap>joy
You can see right over the water. ####<iemocap>joy
At least we won't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
Maybe this is the right place after all. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm sorry, Augie. ####<iemocap>sadness
About what I was just saying. ####<iemocap>neutral
It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are we talking about the same thing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, then what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We're not seeing the grunions? ####<iemocap>neutral
We missed them twice. That's not ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We'll see them this time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
God, I thought you wanted to see it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Wait a minute. I got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet? A poodle? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla? ####<iemocap>angry
Jesus, welcome to the human race. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I know. Me neither. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't. ####<iemocap>joy
Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here. ####<iemocap>joy
Look what we got here. ####<iemocap>joy
It's not champagne. ####<iemocap>joy
Are you still cold? Do you want to go home? ####<iemocap>neutral
Shh. ####<iemocap>neutral
If we're very quiet the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you think it's them? ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
What are we to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't laugh at me. I'm serious. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh dear, well, shall we want that? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh? ####<iemocap>sadness
Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>joy
yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me. ####<iemocap>joy
The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it. ####<iemocap>excited
We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then I don't care. ####<iemocap>neutral
things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they? ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want. ####<iemocap>excited
Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right. ####<iemocap>excited
Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>excited
Remember that awful scene we had in Venice? ####<iemocap>excited
That was a rouser, wasn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, it's true. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's become a habit with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't be so stupid. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>angry
It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute? ####<iemocap>neutral
No, it isn't. ####<iemocap>angry
Adders don't snap, they sting. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They sting. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Mind your business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You've always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do shut up. Shut up. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want to talk about this anymore. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Turn it on. ####<iemocap>angry
I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, yes I am. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment. ####<iemocap>angry
Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute. ####<iemocap>angry
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>angry
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him. ####<iemocap>angry
I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste. ####<iemocap>angry
You let him kiss you. You said so. ####<iemocap>angry
What about me? ####<iemocap>angry
That's a nice point of view, I must say. ####<iemocap>angry
Are you bored with this conversation? ####<iemocap>neutral
So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy? ####<iemocap>neutral

I'm not in the least bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry

Okay.  Get on the phone and figure out where my luggage is and tell me when it's going to get there alright? ####<iemocap>angry
And and, in about... ####<iemocap>angry
Two days I'll be in San Diego and how's it going to get to me in San Diego?  You going to make sure it gets to the San Diego airport? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can you get it to the San Diego airport?  You get someone to drive it to my place alright? Then I get a refund for some...I get a free flight alright? I get free whatever. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  And you're going to give me what for my inconvenience? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Some peanuts?  Wow.  That helps a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Thanks you, thank you I don't have my luggage so you gave me a Holiday Inn stay and peanuts.  Wow.  You know what? ####<iemocap>angry
I will never do business with Delta again. ####<iemocap>angry
How's it going?  How are you feeling? ####<iemocap>sadness
Hanging in there? ####<iemocap>sadness
So sad. ####<iemocap>sadness

Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm so sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well now you can follow his footsteps, you know?  Carry out what he wanted to do. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well sure you could. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
I would've loved to. ####<iemocap>sadness
Now I can't. ####<iemocap>sadness
I ah-- ####<iemocap>sadness
alright. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
It just feels like I was talking to him yesterday. ####<iemocap>sadness
He was my only friend growing up. ####<iemocap>sadness
no one else would talk to me but he would. ####<iemocap>sadness
He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know I was always the one to tell him to be more wild you know? ####<iemocap>sadness
And he just took it overboard. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know a stupid case of drunk driving it's just... ####<iemocap>sadness
and the worst part of it is that he was in the car with his girlfriend, ####<iemocap>sadness
his girlfriend got killed too. ####<iemocap>sadness
And the car that he hit was his family. ####<iemocap>sadness
The mother and father died-- ####<iemocap>sadness
and the kids are paralyzed in a coma right now. ####<iemocap>sadness
and just going to the funeral it's- ####<iemocap>sadness
-do I miss him or do I hate him, you know? ####<iemocap>sadness
I was supposed to see him last summer ####<iemocap>sadness
then I got busy with work and stuff and three years go by ####<iemocap>sadness
and then something like this happens you know? ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean I haven't even talked to him on the phone for the past three months. ####<iemocap>sadness
He's supposed to be my best friend. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's so fucked up. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why is that? ####<iemocap>sadness
He was studying to be a doctor. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean he was...he wanted to help people in poor countries, that is his goal.  He didn't care about the money.  He just wanted to go and help people. ####<iemocap>sadness
What the...what am I doing? ####<iemocap>sadness
Working for corporate America?  Wow. ####<iemocap>sadness
He actually wanted to do something. ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't do that. ####<iemocap>sadness
You should've met him. ####<iemocap>sadness
He is the greatest...everyone liked him. ####<iemocap>sadness

I don't, I don't know what the problem is.  That's what I want you guys to...why is my service not turned on?  And I paid my bills on time.  I don't understand. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  Well that is, that is fine and all.  I don't care.  I really don't care because I want my phone to work that's all. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That is I am paying you guys for service and I'm not getting any service.  I get, I get just dropped calls all the time and now it's completely not working at all.  I can't even call out, nine one one probably wouldn't even work. ####<iemocap>frustrated

I am a realtor and this is my business.  People are calling me all the time but you know, and I don't have a land line.  I can't afford to have a land line ####<iemocap>angry
That you better be sorry. ####<iemocap>angry

What are you, what are you a police officer now?  You know, like I'm done, I'm over it.  Goodbye and I hope that you lose your job. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hello.  This is Viacom Services.  How can I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry ma'am, what can I help you with? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Can you give me the last four digits of your social security number so I can verify who I'm speaking with? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  And your name is? ####<iemocap>neutral
Olivia. Um. Okay.  So how long has this problem been? ####<iemocap>neutral
So what exactly is the problem? ####<iemocap>neutral
Um- I think part of it has to do with the network being down.  It's been having some trouble the last few weeks-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I understand--we're not- ####<iemocap>neutral
No.  Okay.  We're not charging you for any of these months.  We're going to give you three months free. ####<iemocap>neutral
We can give you a new phone-- ####<iemocap>neutral
We can do that.  We can do that.  You just have to sign a one-year contract though with the-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Besides, it's sort of out of hands at the moment----The whole electrical power outage. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um- Let me connect you to my supervisor.  Actually, he's out right now so I'm supervisor until he comes back. Um- ####<iemocap>neutral
So you could----speak with me some more, you could call back later on maybe. ####<iemocap>neutral
I didn't put you on hold. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There are a lot of people calling us having problems.  Every phone company is having the same problems ma'am ####<iemocap>frustrated
Mmm hmmm.  Mmm hmmm.  The power outages, everything, hurricane Katrina. Everything's really messed up. ####<iemocap>neutral

I'm really sorry ma'am.  There's not----a lot we can do for it. ####<iemocap>neutral
What I can do for you, if you want to make a call right now I could contact you through our computer.  I can call through my phone and you can speak through me. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry it has to do with an electrical power outage and stuff-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, okay I'm going to give you a free phone card that you can use at any payphone and that's on us. Okay? ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm, I'm sorry you chose to live there um-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I'm sure maybe there's a phone at work you could use. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right um-- ####<iemocap>neutral
My name is Sara. ####<iemocap>neutral
Sara Brown. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know maam, we record this conversation so anything you say can be proven in a law of court so keep that in mind. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh God I finally got...you know how long I've been waiting on line?  You put on hold for like five hours.  Geez. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've already been through this five times with these people.  I've been calling every single day. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Olivia Brown. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well my phone isn't working and it hasn't been working for the last five days. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, yeah, yeah you better be sorry. ####<iemocap>angry
No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay?  And it [GARBAGE]. My business is failing because my phone isn't working and I don't have a land line and I really can't handle this right now. ####<iemocap>frustrated
the symptoms- This [GARBAGE] a doctor's office. I'm not receiving calls...I can't receive- no, it's, it cuts me off-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes the phone turns on.  No I mean I'm using it not turning on the phone.  Of course it turns on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No- I don't have a sim card because it's Verizon and you guys don't use sim cards. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay no.  Sir, this is the deal.  My phone isn't working and I don't care what the problem is but it needs to work.  That's why I'm paying you guys to fix it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know even how to use that stuff it's too complicated.  I just want my flip phone to work----that's all I need ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, I am on the road all the time.  Do you understand how important?  I'm a woman, a single mother by herself working...what? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Brent Backersen, I am writing this down, Brent Backersen.  Alright. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I, I, I don't want a contract. Okay. I don't want any contracts. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Really?  No contract? ####<iemocap>frustrated

Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral

Is the phone turned on? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, um- okay.  Your sim card is in- didn't fall out- ####<iemocap>neutral
Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause-- ####<iemocap>neutral

Okay.  How about this we'll send you a brand new camera phone with palm pilot-- and- ####<iemocap>neutral
So we'll send it- And we'll give you, how about a free year's service? ####<iemocap>neutral

and battling through with us. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes.  You just tell them Brent Backersen sent you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening. ####<iemocap>neutral
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up, he was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
When? ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
He cried hard? ####<iemocap>sadness
Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this? ####<iemocap>sadness
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one. ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I'm just saying-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Did you ask Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean... ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No I don't want a diagram. ####<iemocap>frustrated
He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that. ####<iemocap>angry
Tell me something.  You can leave this business? ####<iemocap>sadness
Alright but you can't talk like that you hear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand you do I? ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I can see that. ####<iemocap>sadness
He saw it. ####<iemocap>sadness
He was out there when it happened. ####<iemocap>sadness
About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone. ####<iemocap>sadness
I could hear it right through the floor. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess he is. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad. ####<iemocap>sadness
Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him. ####<iemocap>angry
No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope? ####<iemocap>angry
That we haven't had any hope for years now? ####<iemocap>angry
Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright. Alright. Alright just listen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know why I asked Annie here, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
I want to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back ####<iemocap>frustrated
My whole entire, bloody life time and time again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well to hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
I wanted to get this settled first. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then I guess that's the end of it. ####<iemocap>neutral
But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out. ####<iemocap>sadness
And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright then. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
But if I can't have that here I'll get out. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York. ####<iemocap>neutral
I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it. ####<iemocap>angry
The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. ####<iemocap>angry
Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes.  On this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  Just you help me stay here. ####<iemocap>sadness
I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why did he invite her here? ####<iemocap>angry
Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up. ####<iemocap>angry
No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that. ####<iemocap>angry
I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock. ####<iemocap>angry
My worst times I think about her, you know, and I ####<iemocap>sadness
it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother. ####<iemocap>angry
Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me. ####<iemocap>angry
Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe. ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why does that bother you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her. ####<iemocap>neutral
uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Who said he even thought about that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, so what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Now listen kid... ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm? ####<iemocap>neutral
Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do?  What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But Kate... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all? ####<iemocap>angry
Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all? ####<iemocap>angry
Look at you, you're shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay. ####<iemocap>sadness
Look, ####<iemocap>sadness
you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of... ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, ####<iemocap>joy
I guess that's why I came. ####<iemocap>joy
Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now. ####<iemocap>joy
Look, I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>joy
You started to write me. ####<iemocap>joy
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say? ####<iemocap>joy
You'd always be so ambiguous. ####<iemocap>joy
I'll never forgive you for that. ####<iemocap>joy
I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you. ####<iemocap>joy
Not like that you're not. ####<iemocap>joy
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
Geez. ####<iemocap>sadness
And you still feel that way? ####<iemocap>sadness
that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that. ####<iemocap>sadness
What am I going to do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
You're not sorry you came? ####<iemocap>neutral
Why? ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here. ####<iemocap>joy
I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
You felt something that far back. ####<iemocap>joy
Give me a kiss Ann, just give me... ####<iemocap>joy
Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. ####<iemocap>excited
We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy. ####<iemocap>joy
Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you. ####<iemocap>sadness
You remember overseas I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket. ####<iemocap>sadness
That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly. ####<iemocap>sadness
A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created. ####<iemocap>sadness
It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me? ####<iemocap>sadness
And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him. ####<iemocap>sadness
And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook, ####<iemocap>sadness
open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator ####<iemocap>sadness
cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you. ####<iemocap>joy
Buy some hats? ####<iemocap>joy
Yes. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's past eleven, let's go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is no point in coming down here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's my point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just not. ####<iemocap>neutral
You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything. ####<iemocap>excited
You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell. ####<iemocap>excited
But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight. ####<iemocap>excited
God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around? ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it. ####<iemocap>excited
But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah they do. ####<iemocap>excited
Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable. ####<iemocap>excited
We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, is that...no is that just seaweed? ####<iemocap>excited
You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything. ####<iemocap>excited
I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute. ####<iemocap>excited
Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies... ####<iemocap>excited
...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters. ####<iemocap>excited
It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim. ####<iemocap>excited
They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up. ####<iemocap>excited
[BREATHING] So what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
About what I just said? ####<iemocap>excited
It certainly is not.  It's ####<iemocap>frustrated
About what? ####<iemocap>angry
It's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>angry
It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now. ####<iemocap>angry
Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me. ####<iemocap>angry
For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We never do, do we?  Have we ever? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever. ####<iemocap>angry
Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's... ####<iemocap>frustrated
Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up. ####<iemocap>angry
God, you don't understand anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie. ####<iemocap>angry
Look, do you remember the first time we came here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We thought I was pregnant. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember something... ####<iemocap>sadness
Rather not hope for something. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No...No...No... ####<iemocap>frustrated
No... ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be. ####<iemocap>angry
This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be. ####<iemocap>angry
This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice. ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't help thinking about being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you. ####<iemocap>sadness
If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh you brought refreshments. ####<iemocap>joy
No I'm beginning to think you might be right. ####<iemocap>joy
I think this may be the place for us after all. ####<iemocap>joy
I am sorry Augie. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
So what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
About what I just said? ####<iemocap>frustrated
It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are we talking about the same thing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I thought you wanted to see it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Carla, can I ask you something? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What's bugging you then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I thought you wanted to see it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, we're going to see it. ####<iemocap>neutral
What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight. ####<iemocap>neutral
And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Wait a minute.  I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker... ####<iemocap>neutral
And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you want me to get some champagne? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Welcome to the human race. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No. ####<iemocap>angry
I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids... ####<iemocap>angry
...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes it is. ####<iemocap>angry
Right. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm trying to do the best I can. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Maybe if you were with someone else too. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know.  But I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here. ####<iemocap>joy
Hey, look what we got here. ####<iemocap>joy
Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Now and always sweet. ####<iemocap>excited
I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later. ####<iemocap>excited
That sent shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>excited
That's serious enough. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>excited
No, wrong number. ####<iemocap>excited
I didn't hit you very hard. ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Presents?  A trivial little broach. ####<iemocap>angry
No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination. ####<iemocap>neutral
Just a little perhaps but nothing serious. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing. ####<iemocap>angry
It's become a habit with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>angry
No, just making myself beautiful for you. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Adders don't snap, they sting. ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. ####<iemocap>angry
Mind your business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You've always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
They are away in Tunis. ####<iemocap>neutral
Turn it on again, please. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me. ####<iemocap>angry
Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment- ####<iemocap>angry
Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>angry
You must admit he was in love with you. ####<iemocap>angry
You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it? ####<iemocap>angry
And what about me? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff. ####<iemocap>angry
You want some brandy? ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll have a little I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh my...just because I just...okay... ####<iemocap>angry
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment. ####<iemocap>angry
Really Amanda. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nothing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Going out somewhere dear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Actually that's perfectly true. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes it is. ####<iemocap>neutral
I think that ####<iemocap>neutral
They snap. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not in the least bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine? ####<iemocap>angry
We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, thanks.  I think I will. ####<iemocap>angry
You better turn that off. ####<iemocap>angry
No I'll do no such thing. ####<iemocap>angry
Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it--Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Very amusing indeed. ####<iemocap>angry
You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going nowhere. No you're not. ####<iemocap>angry
Just shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh. ####<iemocap>angry
Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes.  I'm just trying to get a new license. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  I did- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did exactly what they told me to do. ####<iemocap>angry
I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, that's nice. That's nice but I have done everything you people have told me to do. I don't understand why you can't just help me get this done.  It's simple, right?  License.  I need it. Can we just do this please? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've been to the back of the line five times. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again? ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go. ####<iemocap>angry
I have been waiting for over an hour. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again. ####<iemocap>angry
Look can you not just help me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here. ####<iemocap>angry
This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm testing your patience? ####<iemocap>angry
I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay. ####<iemocap>angry
Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please. ####<iemocap>angry
Uh, lets- What do you need exactly? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You need a new license, is that what you're telling me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am I cannot help you.  You need to fill out a new form and you need to get in the back of the line. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've got a life too ma'am ####<iemocap>angry
and I got to - i got to work here all day long.  Okay.  I've got to deal with you people all day. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So what I need you to do is I need you to fill out this form correctly and go to the back of the line. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing. ####<iemocap>angry
What I need you to do is go to the back of the line, ####<iemocap>frustrated
fill out this form and wait ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're going to have to go back again. ####<iemocap>angry
and you filled out- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now. ####<iemocap>angry
This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that ####<iemocap>frustrated
and, uh, throw it away. I need you to fill out a new form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am you're going to have- you- look. You really- you really ####<iemocap>frustrated
like I said before right now. ####<iemocap>angry
Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're testing my goddamn patience. ####<iemocap>angry
I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay? ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah.  They just called. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you think I want to leave you? ####<iemocap>sadness
I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up? ####<iemocap>sadness
Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on ####<iemocap>frustrated
And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What's that supposed to mean? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back? ####<iemocap>angry
What do you want me to do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Thanks that helps. ####<iemocap>angry
I feel much better now. ####<iemocap>angry
I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I will but I can't right now. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's how you want to leave it? ####<iemocap>angry
I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here. ####<iemocap>sadness
Fine. ####<iemocap>sadness
So you're leaving tomorrow. ####<iemocap>sadness
This is really-this is unfair. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't see [BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back. ####<iemocap>sadness
You don't know that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You have a choice. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here. ####<iemocap>sadness
Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't deal with this emotionally. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's all I'm saying... No you don't. ####<iemocap>angry
It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then- ####<iemocap>angry
Then go.  We'll be here when you get back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you? ####<iemocap>sadness
You want me tell you that I'm okay with it? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way. ####<iemocap>sadness
I have something to tell you. ####<iemocap>excited
It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess? ####<iemocap>excited
Look. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married. ####<iemocap>excited

We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff. ####<iemocap>joy
So pretty. ####<iemocap>excited
Very Midsummer Night's wedding. ####<iemocap>joy
Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies. ####<iemocap>excited
Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help ####<iemocap>excited
plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah? ####<iemocap>excited
Really? ####<iemocap>excited
Okay.  It's going to be in, like, six months.  So we don't have a really long time. ####<iemocap>excited
Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes. ####<iemocap>excited
because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget. ####<iemocap>excited
Ha ha ha. ####<iemocap>excited
Ha ha. ####<iemocap>excited
Just couldn't be any cooler. ####<iemocap>excited
I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening. ####<iemocap>excited
You don't look like you're going to faint. ####<iemocap>excited
So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited? ####<iemocap>excited
You haven't ruined it yet. ####<iemocap>excited
You really like ####<iemocap>excited
You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know. ####<iemocap>excited
[laughter] ####<iemocap>excited
What?  You seem so excited. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog. ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you serious?  You're getting married. ####<iemocap>neutral
Holy shit that's amazing. ####<iemocap>excited
Congratulations. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm invited, right. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  I'll help plan. ####<iemocap>excited
Why not browns? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's a light brown, tanish. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is- ####<iemocap>neutral
I know but you just asked me to- ####<iemocap>neutral
Come on.  Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  Fine.  So green and what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Blue? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, fine. Greens and blues. ####<iemocap>neutral
Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fried chicken, mashed potatoes. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm thrilled.  God. ####<iemocap>excited
Just ecstatic.  I can't believe you're my best friend ####<iemocap>excited
You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing ####<iemocap>excited
Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm so- all the blood ####<iemocap>excited
has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm getting a little weak in the knees. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's helpful. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am try-  it's been three years ####<iemocap>frustrated
and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that. ####<iemocap>angry
What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore. ####<iemocap>angry
Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong. ####<iemocap>angry
Well don't you understand that this is- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use. ####<iemocap>angry
I mean it's not like this is an ####<iemocap>angry
extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay. Okay, Fine. ####<iemocap>angry
Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong? ####<iemocap>angry
I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot- ####<iemocap>angry
Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  Usually. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I- I make my ####<iemocap>frustrated
I make myself very presentable before I go to any kind of interview. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Buck-O. That's really helpful.  Just keep chugging along.  The little engine that could. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well you- just you're doing something wrong. ####<iemocap>angry
Well maybe you could help.  I mean you've got a job.  I'm willing to look outside of my realm.  I could try something else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll get it.  I just need a job.  I don't care what it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper. ####<iemocap>frustrated
