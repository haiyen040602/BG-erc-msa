I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job. ####<iemocap>angry
I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was. ####<iemocap>angry
Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's important.  That's really important. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I guess you're not trying hard enough. ####<iemocap>neutral
Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just- ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hey.  Look, I mean- you know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
You need that- Time- ####<iemocap>neutral
You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean- ####<iemocap>neutral
look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean- ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  I mean whatever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, I understand, but- ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean- ####<iemocap>neutral
Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong. ####<iemocap>neutral
'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And- ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview? ####<iemocap>neutral
And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything? ####<iemocap>neutral
and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like, ####<iemocap>neutral
you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent. ####<iemocap>neutral
or some- some large percent of- of success. ####<iemocap>neutral
Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go- ####<iemocap>neutral
Look if I could give you a job,if I could give you a job I would but I mean I'm not in that position. I'm- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I- ####<iemocap>neutral
So, go to McDonalds. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well you're going to have to.  You don't really have an option.  What's your problem? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know it's like I'm trying to be- ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm trying to be helpful. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm trying to watch TV. ####<iemocap>neutral
You guys lost my bag. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  Yeah I did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Lost it just, like, I mean, ####<iemocap>angry
it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention ####<iemocap>angry
because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone. ####<iemocap>angry
Wait.  What? ####<iemocap>neutral
No. No. I heard- I heard what you said. ####<iemocap>angry
You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it. ####<iemocap>angry
Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that. ####<iemocap>angry
I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it. ####<iemocap>angry
I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make- ####<iemocap>angry
You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable. ####<iemocap>angry
No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option. ####<iemocap>angry
I want to talk to your supervisor. ####<iemocap>angry
I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this. ####<iemocap>angry
Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you? ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate. ####<iemocap>angry
Welcome to Northwest Airlines.  How can I help you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Did you file a complaint already? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am, I understand that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage. ####<iemocap>frustrated
At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you- ####<iemocap>frustrated
you're getting very excited right now ####<iemocap>frustrated
I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim. ####<iemocap>frustrated
If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We're just talking over each other. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We're not going to communicate anything this way. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to ####<iemocap>frustrated
sign away your luggage to the ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement, ####<iemocap>frustrated
terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over ####<iemocap>frustrated
The best that we can do for you is give you- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am- I am- I am my own supervisor. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am the supervisor, ma'am. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am the current manager on duty. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am, I own Northwest Airlines. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Thanks. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know? ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. I know. I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was- ####<iemocap>sadness
He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that. ####<iemocap>sadness
It just doesn't seem fair. ####<iemocap>sadness
Thank you for being here. ####<iemocap>sadness
[LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party. ####<iemocap>joy
And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's- ####<iemocap>sadness
When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition, ####<iemocap>neutral
you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like ####<iemocap>sadness
you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them. ####<iemocap>sadness
You're okay ####<iemocap>sadness
You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can. ####<iemocap>sadness
So- ####<iemocap>sadness
Guess what came today? ####<iemocap>excited
My acceptance letter. ####<iemocap>excited
From U.S.C.. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes, I am. ####<iemocap>excited
Well yeah, that's the general idea. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Big bad acceptance packet with all the information.  I'm going to U.S.C.. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] It's safe around there. ####<iemocap>excited
The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present? ####<iemocap>excited
There we go.  Perfect. ####<iemocap>excited
And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't want any of those little puny ones. ####<iemocap>excited
Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving. ####<iemocap>excited
U.S.C. has a major in that, right. ####<iemocap>excited
They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever. ####<iemocap>excited
Okay.  Well I'm lying but- ####<iemocap>excited
Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out. ####<iemocap>excited
okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time. ####<iemocap>excited
So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then- ####<iemocap>excited
Everything worked out perfectly. ####<iemocap>excited
I know.  We should have a party. ####<iemocap>excited
An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Right.  Now you're with me. ####<iemocap>excited
That is why I got accepted. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. ####<iemocap>excited
What- what did you have in mind? ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
On occasion I've heard of it. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  Totally. ####<iemocap>excited
I am totally down with the ice cream. ####<iemocap>excited
Eh, we can work that part out. ####<iemocap>excited
Alright. ####<iemocap>excited
party. ####<iemocap>excited
I know. ####<iemocap>excited
Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that. ####<iemocap>excited
Well no.  I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job ####<iemocap>excited
while I'm in school.  It'll be good. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster. ####<iemocap>excited
I know.  Right down the street. ####<iemocap>excited
Excellent.  Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for. ####<iemocap>excited
Okay.  No, that's dorky. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Student counsel? ####<iemocap>excited
No, it's dorky. ####<iemocap>excited
Social life.  Hello. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER]. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER]. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the ####<iemocap>excited
What have you heard about the Greek system? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college. ####<iemocap>excited
That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
me. ####<iemocap>excited
Hey, what's up? ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>excited
Get out. ####<iemocap>neutral
You serious? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's awesome.  Congratulations. ####<iemocap>excited
That's amazing.  Wow. ####<iemocap>excited
I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night- ####<iemocap>neutral
So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in? ####<iemocap>neutral
they have that as a major? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Seriously, what's your major? ####<iemocap>neutral
So you're undecided? ####<iemocap>neutral
Hey, that's cool. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, well- ####<iemocap>neutral
You- you- you'll find. ####<iemocap>neutral
You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right. ####<iemocap>neutral
A party celebrating your acceptance. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's cool. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm ####<iemocap>excited
I don't know are you, like, I don't know.  Are you, like, available or anything? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I mean I don't know.  It's like you know I kind of had a crush on you throughout high school and, like ####<iemocap>excited
I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is. ####<iemocap>excited
Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and ####<iemocap>excited
actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you-  it's Red Lobster.  It's like down on ####<iemocap>excited
Vermont. ####<iemocap>excited
Wait, you've been there before? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing. ####<iemocap>excited
Okay.  Putt-putt golfing? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go. ####<iemocap>excited
I can see it in your eyes.  You want to go. ####<iemocap>excited
Good. Alright we're so happy. ####<iemocap>excited
That's right.  Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school. ####<iemocap>excited
Are you going to take out loans or- ####<iemocap>neutral
But, um- ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, like, I don't know.  I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash.  You can, you know ####<iemocap>neutral
Or library. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just said the library ####<iemocap>neutral
or, um, campus cruiser.  You can drive people around. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right or you can run for student counsel. ####<iemocap>neutral
Dorky? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's important. ####<iemocap>neutral
Fine.  It's dorky. ####<iemocap>neutral
But that'll fit you  because you're a dork. ####<iemocap>neutral
I dork. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by ####<iemocap>neutral
lots of drunk frat boys ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year? ####<iemocap>neutral
I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so- ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus ####<iemocap>neutral
that happened, you know, that was going on. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you? ####<iemocap>joy
Okay.  Well, Did you go through the automated menu?  Most of your requests can be taken care of through that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Well I'd be happy to- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, sir.  I'd be happy to help you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint? ####<iemocap>neutral
Can you be a little more specific, sir? ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address. ####<iemocap>neutral
I understand, sir.  I will explain to them what the situa- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, sir.  They- they have to- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sir. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sir, they have to take down your address at the other station.  I will transfer.  I will explain everything to them.  It will all be fine.  I promise. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Cindy? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sir, I don't think my name is really relevant- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright, sir. Sir.  I'm going to transfer you to the address. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright.  You know what, sir.  The customer is always right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I will go ahead and I will take- I will take ####<iemocap>frustrated
But I'm giving you what you want. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  Great. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, um.  I have been trying to reach somebody who will refund, uh, my money. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food ####<iemocap>neutral
um and everything was pretty much uh- uh- just not done right. All the orders were messed up. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, I did and that didn't- I got through to, like, one operator and she sent me to like three others ####<iemocap>frustrated
If you could just give me that, then I will leave you alone. And just- if i could also- What? ####<iemocap>frustrated
The food was prepared incorrectly. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I asked for no tomatoes. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now ####<iemocap>angry
and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator. ####<iemocap>angry
You're going to fill out a form on your desk ####<iemocap>angry
because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents. ####<iemocap>angry
What's your name? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Cindy?  Cindy what? ####<iemocap>angry
Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check ####<iemocap>angry
attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset. ####<iemocap>angry
You know what.  I- You know what? You know what? No, it's fine. it's fine it's fine You know what? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Hey, Cindy. Cindy, look I know this is not your fault.  Do whatever you want. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Send me to whatever operator. I just- You know what?  I'm just done.  I'm just done.  I've lost all hope. ####<iemocap>frustrated
of getting my sixteen dollars back. It fine, no honestly. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, Cindy just don't even-look don't even.  Cuz I- look Cindy I know you don't care about me, okay.  I know that I'm just like another person who calls- ####<iemocap>frustrated
No it doesn't matter.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Just send me to the next operator.  That's fine. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want to do, argue with him? ####<iemocap>angry
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>angry
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it? ####<iemocap>angry
To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you? ####<iemocap>angry
The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry. ####<iemocap>angry
Well that's only your business, Chris. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm just saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl. ####<iemocap>angry
Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you? ####<iemocap>angry
You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>angry
Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't? ####<iemocap>angry
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright but don't think that way ####<iemocap>angry
because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris. ####<iemocap>angry
But don't think that way.  You hear me? ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah.  I can see that. ####<iemocap>angry
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone. ####<iemocap>sadness
I could hear him right through the floor of my room. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him? ####<iemocap>angry
I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore. ####<iemocap>angry
We've got to say it to him. ####<iemocap>angry
For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane. ####<iemocap>angry
Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know why. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not only my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then it isn't just my business. ####<iemocap>angry
Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it. ####<iemocap>angry
Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>angry
I wanted to get this settled first. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out. ####<iemocap>frustrated
and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>angry
So what I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>angry
Because it is. ####<iemocap>angry
These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? ####<iemocap>sadness
I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry ####<iemocap>angry
and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The business, the business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then you help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know.  Just you help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why did he invite her? ####<iemocap>angry
It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden? ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What's going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
No, line. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married? ####<iemocap>angry
Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited. ####<iemocap>angry
Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock. ####<iemocap>angry
In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe- ####<iemocap>angry
Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You above all have got to believe.  You. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just don't stop believing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why does that bother you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Listen kid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe ####<iemocap>neutral
You can't read her mind. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know why she waited? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But Kate- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why me above all? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I guess this is why I came. ####<iemocap>joy
Chris, I've been ready a long, long time. ####<iemocap>joy
You started to write me. ####<iemocap>joy
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know. ####<iemocap>joy
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
What'll I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
What? ####<iemocap>angry
I guess you know this is why I asked you to come. ####<iemocap>neutral
Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you. ####<iemocap>joy
I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I ####<iemocap>joy
And he's gone forever.  You're sure? ####<iemocap>neutral
Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you. ####<iemocap>joy
I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you. ####<iemocap>joy
Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy. ####<iemocap>joy
No, nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know where to start. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's so many things mixed up. ####<iemocap>sadness
You remember overseas I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. ####<iemocap>sadness
I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made ####<iemocap>sadness
a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me? ####<iemocap>sadness
And then I came home and it was amazing. ####<iemocap>sadness
I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow ####<iemocap>sadness
because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. ####<iemocap>sadness
I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator. ####<iemocap>sadness
when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you. ####<iemocap>joy
Fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not yours. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's after eleven let's go home. ####<iemocap>angry
There is no point in coming down here. ####<iemocap>angry
That's my point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So let's go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Not particularly. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't.  It's stupid. ####<iemocap>angry
Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die. ####<iemocap>angry
What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just not. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes. ####<iemocap>angry
We didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>angry
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
About what? ####<iemocap>angry
It's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>angry
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better. ####<iemocap>joy
Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Whose is it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well sure. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember? ####<iemocap>excited
Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket. ####<iemocap>neutral
Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now. ####<iemocap>joy
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's my point too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do ####<iemocap>frustrated
like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic ####<iemocap>excited
a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For real? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We weren't in a good spot. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot. ####<iemocap>angry
I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it. ####<iemocap>excited
Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute. ####<iemocap>excited
Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote. ####<iemocap>excited
No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming. ####<iemocap>excited
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters. ####<iemocap>excited
It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge. ####<iemocap>excited
They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place ####<iemocap>excited
where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death. ####<iemocap>excited
Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up. ####<iemocap>excited
It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach. ####<iemocap>angry
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
For heaven's sake, this is not about fish. ####<iemocap>angry
We totally skipped. Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions. ####<iemocap>angry
We never do.  Do we have we ever? ####<iemocap>angry
Twice is every time we've tried that's ever. ####<iemocap>angry
and the fish won't show up. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes ####<iemocap>sadness
and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me ####<iemocap>sadness
right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>angry
This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting. ####<iemocap>angry
I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else ####<iemocap>frustrated
somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, Augie you brought refreshments. ####<iemocap>joy
Well then I guess we don't need glasses. ####<iemocap>joy
I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, so what do you think? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice that's not ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We'll see them this year. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I thought you wanted to see it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Wait a minute.  I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it. ####<iemocap>excited
You want me to get some champagne? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Want to get married again? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What?  What do you want a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get, ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Maybe if you were with somebody else too. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
Actually now that you mention it, no I don't. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well look at what we got here. ####<iemocap>excited
It's not champagne. ####<iemocap>neutral
Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>excited
Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy. ####<iemocap>excited
It's true the whole business is very poor joke. ####<iemocap>excited
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious. ####<iemocap>excited
Who's they? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours? ####<iemocap>excited
What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh? ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you. ####<iemocap>excited
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. ####<iemocap>excited
It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom. ####<iemocap>excited
Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers. ####<iemocap>excited
How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>excited
And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>excited
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
It must be them then. ####<iemocap>neutral
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us? ####<iemocap>excited
With the most perfect poise. ####<iemocap>excited
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they? ####<iemocap>excited
Don't say that, my darling. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well who knows? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you remember that awful scene in Venice? ####<iemocap>neutral
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
Horrible thing.  I hated it. ####<iemocap>neutral
How long did that row last? ####<iemocap>neutral
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown. ####<iemocap>neutral
What of it? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No thanks. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's become a habit with you. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, don't be so stupid. ####<iemocap>angry
What? ####<iemocap>angry
Just making myself fascinating for you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, no it isn't ####<iemocap>frustrated
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. ####<iemocap>angry
Adders don't snap they sting. ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I did quite a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Mind your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio. ####<iemocap>angry
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
Go away, go away.  I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end do you understand?  The end, ####<iemocap>angry
finally and forever ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, I am.  Let go of me. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. ####<iemocap>angry
I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine. ####<iemocap>angry
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. ####<iemocap>angry
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>angry
You let him kiss you.  You said you did. ####<iemocap>angry
What of it? ####<iemocap>angry
What about me? ####<iemocap>angry
That's a nice point of view, I must say. ####<iemocap>angry
I'll have some myself, I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Really, Amanda. ####<iemocap>angry
Nothing. ####<iemocap>angry
Going somewhere, my dear? ####<iemocap>angry
Snap, snap, snap like a little adder. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce? ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm not in the least drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Very good idea.  I will. ####<iemocap>angry
There are people downstairs I suppose. ####<iemocap>angry
This is no time of year for Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Amanda, listen. ####<iemocap>angry
Very amusing. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going like this. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore. ####<iemocap>angry
Okay.  What's the problem? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't have any of ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nope, I don't. I don't have- ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I can't. That's- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time, ####<iemocap>frustrated
but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to ####<iemocap>frustrated
twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't do that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry, but I can't do that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security. ####<iemocap>angry
Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing? ####<iemocap>angry
The one you just came from. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers. ####<iemocap>neutral
And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form ####<iemocap>frustrated
that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, I do. ####<iemocap>neutral
This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't you -- you don't have- ####<iemocap>frustrated
are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not ####<iemocap>frustrated
What if I pay you money? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I -- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's not rocket science. ####<iemocap>angry
Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why are you being such a bitch? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Fine, which line is it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful. ####<iemocap>angry
You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand ####<iemocap>frustrated
You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to? ####<iemocap>sadness
Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then why do you have to go a year at all? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just tell them no. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try? ####<iemocap>frustrated
When do you leave? ####<iemocap>sadness
A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this. ####<iemocap>angry
Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You're not really giving me a lot of options. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's only going to be a year. ####<iemocap>sadness
There's nothing I -- ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, but I'll be back then.  And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't do that.  I have to go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know that. I know that. I know that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go. ####<iemocap>neutral
And this is what I do.  This is -- I mean, this is my life.  And I know that you're part of my life, too, and I mean, it's only -- it's just going to be a year.  I'll be back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's not- it's not- It's not like that.  It's not like that.  I can't do that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it's impossible.  There's -- I just can't.  I can't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's only going to be a year. I'm not going to miss my son's entire life. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because I've already agreed to that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We don't have a choice.  I have to do this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't do it.  I'd love to.  I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, I don't want to -- I don't want to leave.  I want to stay here with you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've asked already.  I can't go back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It can't happen.  I have to go.  I want to stay really bad, but I can't.  There's just no -- I don't have an option. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Next week. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what else to tell -- you know, I mean, I can tell you.  I don't know what else to do. I mean, I've been forced into this situation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing I can do.  I-- I ####<iemocap>frustrated
They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, I-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But I've been trained.  You have no training. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You have to.  Do you understand me?  You have to. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I guess we're at a stalemate then, aren't we? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened? ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture. ####<iemocap>excited
Did she cry? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this? ####<iemocap>excited
I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy! ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, it is. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or-- ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, my God. ####<iemocap>excited
Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church. ####<iemocap>excited
Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there. ####<iemocap>excited
It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like? ####<iemocap>excited
Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so- ####<iemocap>excited
It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing. ####<iemocap>excited
This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh? ####<iemocap>excited
Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know. ####<iemocap>joy
She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so... ####<iemocap>joy
Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know. ####<iemocap>joy
But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of ####<iemocap>joy
Okay. Well there you go. ####<iemocap>excited
Barefoot? ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And-- ####<iemocap>excited
It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and-- ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and- ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to- ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, yeah. ####<iemocap>joy
Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this. ####<iemocap>excited
But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it. ####<iemocap>joy
And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues. ####<iemocap>joy
She's okay with it. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions. ####<iemocap>joy
All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that. ####<iemocap>joy
So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well there has to be something you haven't tried. ####<iemocap>neutral
What about like a temp agency? ####<iemocap>neutral
Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really. ####<iemocap>neutral
If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Excuse me? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well that sounds like your fault. ####<iemocap>neutral
You didn't do what I told you to do. ####<iemocap>neutral
I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions. ####<iemocap>neutral
Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job? ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to, ####<iemocap>frustrated
it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years?  Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just like losing my mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know, ####<iemocap>frustrated
local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody - ####<iemocap>frustrated
there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not choosing. I'm not- ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them ####<iemocap>frustrated
-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is stupid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know what, this is your fault. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, exactly. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because ####<iemocap>frustrated
-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yours.  I don't-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I had- No, I don't.  I'm sorry.  I just totally screwed this one up.  You can stop it I guess. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hi, how can I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Mmhmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar ####<iemocap>neutral
refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes ####<iemocap>neutral
That's our policy, sir. ####<iemocap>neutral
I can't do that. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm very sorry.  I understand you're frustrated. You just got off of a flight. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We'll cover fifty. ####<iemocap>neutral
We only cover fifty do- ####<iemocap>frustrated
We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm very sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight. ####<iemocap>neutral
We really -- we want to work with you. We really -- we want to help. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um- ####<iemocap>neutral
But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can write you the one check. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We'll just throw that in--gratuitously. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And your bag is not my concern. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Then that would be lying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I understand you're frustrated, but-- ####<iemocap>neutral
I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that. ####<iemocap>neutral
But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, yes. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry, really.  But-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
That I'm sorry? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, hi.  Look--Um, okay.  Here's the thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
lost my luggage. Your airline-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss. ####<iemocap>frustrated
'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth. ####<iemocap>frustrated
fifty dollars? ####<iemocap>angry
fifty dollars. No way, no. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy. ####<iemocap>angry
You understand? ####<iemocap>angry
What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all -- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean-- ####<iemocap>angry
You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars. ####<iemocap>angry
You-- ####<iemocap>angry
No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory. ####<iemocap>angry
Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times. ####<iemocap>angry
And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just- ####<iemocap>frustrated
You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just-- ####<iemocap>angry
You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault, ####<iemocap>frustrated
but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen. ####<iemocap>angry
But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person ####<iemocap>frustrated
then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms ####<iemocap>frustrated
with different names on them? That- ####<iemocap>frustrated
but, no. See, 'cause ####<iemocap>frustrated
if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but ####<iemocap>frustrated
um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Please. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm. ####<iemocap>angry
Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks. ####<iemocap>angry
So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm? ####<iemocap>angry
Hey, how you doing? ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm sorry.  It's never easy. ####<iemocap>sadness
But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know -- ####<iemocap>sadness
--it doesn't really do anything.  But-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I know.  It never is. ####<iemocap>sadness
How's, um -- how's his parents doing? ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you- ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, we can be grateful for that. ####<iemocap>sadness
You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that. ####<iemocap>sadness
It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those. ####<iemocap>sadness
I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you. ####<iemocap>sadness
When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean-- ####<iemocap>sadness
Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't have any magic answers.  But, ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
Thanks. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know, ####<iemocap>sadness
a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Thanks. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just -- it's just not fair. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they ####<iemocap>sadness
feel the same way everybody else does. ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't-- ####<iemocap>sadness
This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people - ####<iemocap>sadness
there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know what to do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
What, no way. ####<iemocap>neutral
Really? ####<iemocap>neutral
I didn't even ####<iemocap>excited
know you applied to U.S.C.. ####<iemocap>excited
That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do? ####<iemocap>excited
Right. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes. ####<iemocap>excited
Is U.S.C. known for its history program? ####<iemocap>excited
I know.  It's a great school and you know ####<iemocap>excited
It's all about the connections ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, you did not just say that. ####<iemocap>joy
I know.  You're going to be so close. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm glad you did. ####<iemocap>excited
That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here. ####<iemocap>excited
Everything in LA is twenty minutes away. ####<iemocap>excited
Give or take. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Well congratulations. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
But, congrats on the U.S.C. thing. ####<iemocap>excited
The -- what, the- I mean-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Excuse me? ####<iemocap>neutral
No. ####<iemocap>neutral
Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C.. ####<iemocap>excited
I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
I did.  I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C..  I mean, it's really expensive but ####<iemocap>excited
it's a really good school.  So ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah. ####<iemocap>joy
And, uh- ####<iemocap>joy
Um, you know, I don't think so.  But I think that, you know, it's still a private school ####<iemocap>joy
and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean- ####<iemocap>joy
I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out.  And, like, they have a decent history program. ####<iemocap>joy
So -- and like the geology just is awesome.  It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>joy
Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school ####<iemocap>excited
And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome ####<iemocap>excited
umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses ####<iemocap>excited
find out all this stuff.  And- and I don't know.  I think I'm going to try to live in a dorm. ####<iemocap>excited
Ouch.  That's, um -- oh, wow. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like -- ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll go to basketball games. ####<iemocap>neutral
Maybe some golf matches. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, I'm not going to go to a football game. ####<iemocap>neutral
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way. ####<iemocap>neutral
I do -- I will need to get a gun- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean ####<iemocap>neutral
I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife ####<iemocap>neutral
'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I need to defend myself from ####<iemocap>neutral
Hi.  I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed.  I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm positive.  They came from like another state. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay.  three two three six nine seven five zero six six.  Can we move on? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, and I've been through all of the menus, pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and I'm just trying to get through to a person who can ####<iemocap>frustrated
take off the charges that came from like Nebraska or wherever because, obviously, I didn't make those. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So can you please refund the mischarged charges ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So could you discretion it back? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, but that's like half ####<iemocap>frustrated
of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient.  I know this isn't your fault.  I know that you didn't do it ####<iemocap>frustrated
but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Excuse me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
How long does that take? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Really? ####<iemocap>neutral
You're just going to put it back on my account. ####<iemocap>neutral
So you're just going to take care of this for me? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, my God, thank you so much. ####<iemocap>joy
I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously ####<iemocap>joy
make my life a lot easier. ####<iemocap>joy
Really? ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll ####<iemocap>neutral
call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool ####<iemocap>neutral
You too. ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you for calling Sprint.  We care about everybody.  How can I help you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are you sure you didn't make them? ####<iemocap>neutral
Can I get your phone number, please? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm going to need it again.  I need to look at your file.  If you want me to look at your file-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Umm, Miss Aruckman ####<iemocap>neutral
I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I'm looking at these. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So you're saying that you didn't make these calls. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars. ####<iemocap>neutral
What I can ####<iemocap>neutral
What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form ####<iemocap>neutral
which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint. ####<iemocap>neutral
Ma'am, I understand that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And then then you'll get some money back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here. ####<iemocap>neutral
Sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
You're welcome. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama. ####<iemocap>neutral
God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever ####<iemocap>neutral
if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um. ####<iemocap>neutral
Alright. Take Care. ####<iemocap>neutral
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it. ####<iemocap>neutral
When? ####<iemocap>neutral
He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that? ####<iemocap>sadness
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean, dishonest? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want to do?  Argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't say that to him. ####<iemocap>angry
How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it? ####<iemocap>angry
To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you? ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well that's only your business, Chris. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>angry
Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have -- ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm just saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl. ####<iemocap>angry
Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now what can I do for you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does. ####<iemocap>neutral
The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>angry
Alright, then, mom. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes we did. Do you want to keep going? ####<iemocap>neutral
Just give it some more thought. ####<iemocap>neutral
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
You've got a business here.  What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
You don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you. ####<iemocap>angry
But don't think that way, you hear me? ####<iemocap>angry
He saw it. ####<iemocap>neutral
He was out here when it broke. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've gotta say it to him. ####<iemocap>angry
For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane. ####<iemocap>angry
Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know why. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know it's not only my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, then you know it's not only my business. ####<iemocap>angry
Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I wanted to get this settled first. ####<iemocap>neutral
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Line? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, let's keep going. ####<iemocap>neutral
I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if ####<iemocap>frustrated
father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out. ####<iemocap>sadness
I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, on this I would. ####<iemocap>neutral
Then you help me stay here. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know that.  Just you help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why did he invite her here? ####<iemocap>angry
Why does that bother you? ####<iemocap>neutral
She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden-- ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. ####<iemocap>angry
He's not going to marry her. ####<iemocap>angry
It's got that about it. ####<iemocap>angry
What's going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
Now listen, kid. Now, listen. ####<iemocap>neutral
She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited. ####<iemocap>angry
Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right. ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother. ####<iemocap>angry
I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense. ####<iemocap>angry
Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. ####<iemocap>angry
Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here? ####<iemocap>angry
She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe-- ####<iemocap>angry
Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone ####<iemocap>angry
You, above all, have got to believe.  You. ####<iemocap>angry
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, God, line. ####<iemocap>neutral
What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again? ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know he's even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well so what? ####<iemocap>neutral
Line. ####<iemocap>neutral
Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do? What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, Kate-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Alright, alright.  Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why me above all? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
Every day since. ####<iemocap>joy
I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know. ####<iemocap>joy
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you. ####<iemocap>joy
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, gees. ####<iemocap>sadness
What'll I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know where to start. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company? ####<iemocap>sadness
Well I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made, ####<iemocap>sadness
a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible. ####<iemocap>sadness
There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow ####<iemocap>sadness
because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive; ####<iemocap>sadness
to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man. ####<iemocap>sadness
You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune. ####<iemocap>joy
Fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not yours. ####<iemocap>angry
It's ours.  It's mine, too. ####<iemocap>angry
You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel? ####<iemocap>angry
Yes. ####<iemocap>angry
It's after eleven; let's go home. ####<iemocap>angry
There is no point in coming down here. ####<iemocap>angry
That's my point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So let's go home. ####<iemocap>angry
Not particularly. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just don't.  It's stupid. ####<iemocap>angry
Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die. ####<iemocap>angry
What are you so excited about? ####<iemocap>neutral
This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes. ####<iemocap>angry
Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions. ####<iemocap>angry
We didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's the wind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
About what? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think? ####<iemocap>excited
How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight. ####<iemocap>excited
Whose is it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, sure. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember? ####<iemocap>excited
Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket. ####<iemocap>neutral
You want my jacket? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's my point, too. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's mystery here and magic. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that. ####<iemocap>excited
There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested. ####<iemocap>excited
For real? ####<iemocap>neutral
no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute. ####<iemocap>excited
Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map; ####<iemocap>excited
just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming. ####<iemocap>excited
They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge. ####<iemocap>excited
They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up. ####<iemocap>excited
Well so what did you think? ####<iemocap>excited
Look at this, goose bumps. ####<iemocap>neutral
Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like. ####<iemocap>angry
We never do, do we?  Have we ever? ####<iemocap>angry
Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You don't have any idea what I'm saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is. ####<iemocap>angry
It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork. ####<iemocap>sadness
Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>angry
I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to. ####<iemocap>angry
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting. ####<iemocap>angry
But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like. ####<iemocap>angry
I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie. ####<iemocap>joy
Well so what'd you think? ####<iemocap>neutral
What I said. ####<iemocap>neutral
Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well what's bugging you? ####<iemocap>angry
There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home. ####<iemocap>angry
We'll see them this year. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, of course, not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals; ####<iemocap>frustrated
uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uh. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Wait a minute, I've got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
What, you want me to breathe in your ear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You want to get married again? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What, you want a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No. ####<iemocap>angry
And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I know, me neither. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm doing the best I can. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah? ####<iemocap>neutral
Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here. ####<iemocap>joy
Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Nobody knows we're here, except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>neutral
What are we to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, it sent shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>excited
Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey. ####<iemocap>excited
But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy. ####<iemocap>excited
It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke. ####<iemocap>excited
Who's they? ####<iemocap>excited
If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too. ####<iemocap>neutral
How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours? ####<iemocap>excited
Shall we always want to bicker and fight? ####<iemocap>excited
What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh? ####<iemocap>excited
Well that's serious enough, isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you. ####<iemocap>excited
Which particular one? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. ####<iemocap>excited
It went on intermittently for days. ####<iemocap>excited
It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom. ####<iemocap>excited
That was the first time you ever hit me. ####<iemocap>excited
The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear. ####<iemocap>excited
How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>excited
And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>excited
Good God. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder. ####<iemocap>neutral
It must be them, then. ####<iemocap>neutral
We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care, then. ####<iemocap>excited
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us? ####<iemocap>excited
With the mo- with the most perfect poise? ####<iemocap>excited
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love? ####<iemocap>neutral
You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want. ####<iemocap>neutral
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light. ####<iemocap>angry
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion. ####<iemocap>sadness
Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>excited
Horrible thing.  I hated it. ####<iemocap>angry
Line? ####<iemocap>neutral
How -- that was a rouser wasn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>neutral
That was the first time you ever hit me. ####<iemocap>angry
The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear. ####<iemocap>joy
How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous. ####<iemocap>joy
And very much sillier. ####<iemocap>joy
Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often. ####<iemocap>excited
Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious. ####<iemocap>joy
Let him kiss you. ####<iemocap>neutral
What of it? ####<iemocap>angry
If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, thanks. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's become a habit with you. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, don't be so stupid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What? ####<iemocap>angry
No, just making myself fascinating for you ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, no, it isn't. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, be quiet. ####<iemocap>angry
It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. ####<iemocap>neutral
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Adders don't snap, they sting. ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I did, quite a lot. ####<iemocap>angry
Mind your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
You always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>angry
On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it on again, please. ####<iemocap>angry
Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
Go away.  Go away.  I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
We swapped. Listen. ####<iemocap>neutral
Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, yes, I am. ####<iemocap>angry
Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like. ####<iemocap>angry
Marry you again? Huh. ####<iemocap>angry
Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute. ####<iemocap>angry
Swine. ####<iemocap>angry
I didn't hit you very hard. ####<iemocap>neutral
As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he? ####<iemocap>angry
Line? ####<iemocap>neutral
You let him kiss you.  You said you did. ####<iemocap>angry
What of it? ####<iemocap>angry
What about me? ####<iemocap>angry
That's a nice point of view, I must say. ####<iemocap>angry
So am I; bored stiff. ####<iemocap>angry
I'll have a little myself, I think. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No particular reason.  Anyhow, they were very small ones. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Really, Amanda ####<iemocap>angry
Nothing. ####<iemocap>angry
Going out somewhere, my dear? ####<iemocap>angry
Oh.  That reply has broken my heart. ####<iemocap>frustrated
As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, it is. ####<iemocap>angry
Line? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
Line? ####<iemocap>neutral
Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder. ####<iemocap>angry
They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. ####<iemocap>angry
They snap. ####<iemocap>angry
I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm? ####<iemocap>angry
You must have had a riotous time. ####<iemocap>angry
No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm not in the least drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine? ####<iemocap>angry
Very good idea.  I will ####<iemocap>angry
You better turn that off I think. ####<iemocap>angry
There are people downstairs, I suppose ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Listen-- ####<iemocap>angry
You're a vile tempered, loosed living ####<iemocap>angry
wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not going like this. ####<iemocap>angry
No, you're not. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up. Shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a mean, evil minded ####<iemocap>angry
little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
Whore. ####<iemocap>angry
Hi, I need an ID. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, I'm sorry, but I just stood in this line for an hour.  can I Is there any way I can- ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, they told me-I'm sorry, but they told me to be in this line. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What, I mean what... what's the difference?  What do I need to do there that I can't do here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Can you just-can I just get the right- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Would you be able to put me at the front of that line? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know.  I've been in line with these people.  I understand.  I understand what it's like.  Could you please like call over and- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I hear that.  I hear that.  Thank you, but I've waited in line for so long, and I don't want to have to be here all day. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could- ####<iemocap>neutral
And how long is that going to take? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't have time for this today, and- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Is there anything you can do?  Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line. ####<iemocap>angry
Why not? ####<iemocap>angry
Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you have a manager I could speak with? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are you being straight with me? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Fine. ####<iemocap>frustrated
ahh Yeah, this is the wrong line.  I'm sorry.  You need to go back over to line two B.  That's where you should have started from. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place. ####<iemocap>neutral
Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want to be rude here, ma'am, but line two B is where you need to be.  This is the line for registration. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't have those- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't have those forms, ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am. ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to. ####<iemocap>frustrated
what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
what The lady, what? the janitor? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am.  I think you just said that you were stupid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It doesn't work that way here, ma'am. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I told you it was line two A. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know who told you that but they were wrong.  I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm being very straight with you, ma'am.  There is nothing I can do for you.  You need to stand in line two A. ####<iemocap>frustrated
um. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm sorry.  It's just a lot ahh to explain. ahh I got a call-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I got a call today, ####<iemocap>sadness

Iraq. ####<iemocap>sadness
I think infantry.  I'm not sure. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's going to be at least six months, probably a year. I tried. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know, I know.  It's really, really messed up. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, maybe you should move in with my mom and she can help. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know, I'm just--I'm trying to think of something. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can't what? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't think there's anything we can do. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know.  I know it's not fair. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, apparently nobody else can go. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  Baby, why are you asking me this?  It's just as hard for me.  Please, try to understand that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I understand, baby.  I'm sorry. I mean try to understand I'm I'm scared myself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
We'll figure something out.  We just have to ... we just have to think about this.  Could any of your family help us? ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm going to miss their first words. ####<iemocap>sadness
You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, as much as I can. ####<iemocap>sadness
"sigh" Three weeks. ####<iemocap>sadness

What am I going to do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
The kids- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Where do you have to go?  Where are you going? ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand why they would just do something like this? ####<iemocap>angry
It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know I don't know what I'm going to do.  I don't know how to- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Your Your mom, you want me to move in with your mom? ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's not fair. ####<iemocap>sadness
Why has to be you?  There's all those other people.  Somebody else can go instead.  It's not right. ####<iemocap>sadness
I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I jus- ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know what they're going to say. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, we'll call them.  We'll figure something out.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You're right. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
All the time, every day, every day.  They have e-mail over there and stuff like that, right? I can send you pictures. ####<iemocap>sadness
Three weeks? ####<iemocap>neutral

That'd be great, thanks. ####<iemocap>joy
Brian, I need help. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's not fair. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive. ####<iemocap>angry
I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds? ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is humiliating. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here. ####<iemocap>sadness
Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what? ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any. ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm just worried. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's three years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's really hard to hear. ####<iemocap>sadness
I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money. ####<iemocap>sadness
Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I just-- I ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
charismatic. ####<iemocap>frustrated
yah, to-totally, and I'm not-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I follow up. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just like- it's a matter of- ####<iemocap>frustrated
not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean, anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I'd like to be a working actor. ####<iemocap>neutral
But um-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Bartending, catering. ####<iemocap>neutral
Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad. ####<iemocap>sadness
yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Thank you. ####<iemocap>neutral
I will, I will. ####<iemocap>neutral
Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there? ####<iemocap>neutral
I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job. ####<iemocap>neutral
Nothing's impossible. ####<iemocap>neutral
You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and ####<iemocap>neutral
I ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else. ####<iemocap>neutral
and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now. ####<iemocap>neutral
Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that. ####<iemocap>neutral
[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different? ####<iemocap>neutral
Have you?  There's got to be something else. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this. ####<iemocap>frustrated
If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve. ####<iemocap>neutral
I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that- ####<iemocap>neutral
But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, exactly.  Money is not everything. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen. ####<iemocap>neutral
You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will. ####<iemocap>neutral
But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up. ####<iemocap>neutral
And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you? ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean are you going in for interviews? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you presenting- ####<iemocap>neutral
putting your best foot forward? or you ####<iemocap>neutral
Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them? ####<iemocap>neutral
Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job? ####<iemocap>neutral
Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about? ####<iemocap>neutral
Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course. ####<iemocap>neutral
Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else. ####<iemocap>neutral
So what's the something else? ####<iemocap>neutral
You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back. ####<iemocap>neutral
If I- If you- Will you stick with it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people. ####<iemocap>neutral
But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know I'll always help you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um-Seventeen. Coming from -- ####<iemocap>neutral
It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's good. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out? ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket. ####<iemocap>angry
No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place. ####<iemocap>angry
Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me. ####<iemocap>angry
And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another. ####<iemocap>angry
That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar. ####<iemocap>angry
Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing else you can do? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't believe that for a second. ####<iemocap>angry
What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules? ####<iemocap>angry
You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com- ####<iemocap>angry
So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher? ####<iemocap>frustrated
And you have no guarantee. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want. ####<iemocap>angry
It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Thanks. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, what flight were you on? ####<iemocap>neutral
On what airline? ####<iemocap>neutral
From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints? ####<iemocap>neutral
So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Well, let me see here. I- ####<iemocap>neutral
It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh- ####<iemocap>neutral
But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it? ####<iemocap>neutral
And you couldn't find it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are you sure? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Sentimental value. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, ####<iemocap>neutral
Obviously ma'am. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am sorry, ma'am. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here. ####<iemocap>neutral
Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
That's what the cost of the ticket was for. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. Yes, ma'am. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, my hands are really tied then. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you-- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important? ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, so it was really heavy. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is- ####<iemocap>neutral
makes up? ####<iemocap>neutral
The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I have no guarantee, absolutely not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that. ####<iemocap>neutral
So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag. ####<iemocap>neutral
You have a wonderful day. ####<iemocap>neutral
A good friend of mine passed away the other day. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer, ####<iemocap>sadness
metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but- ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close. ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>sadness
Kind of. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just, I don't know. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know. ####<iemocap>sadness
And he could of...  He was pretty awesome ####<iemocap>sadness
Uh,  We grew up together. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes. ####<iemocap>sadness
I feel really bad for his family, you know. ####<iemocap>sadness
It must be really, really hard to lose a child. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but- ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I'm just going to miss him. ####<iemocap>sadness
Thank you. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something. ####<iemocap>sadness
Thanks. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then... ####<iemocap>sadness
something happens and they die and it's like- ####<iemocap>sadness
really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped. ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>sadness
yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's hard to say good-bye. ####<iemocap>sadness
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>sadness
yeah yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened? ####<iemocap>sadness
That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well? ####<iemocap>sadness
I am so sorry,  It's- ####<iemocap>sadness
It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young? ####<iemocap>sadness
Absolutely, absolutely. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's the think ####<iemocap>sadness
There's no reason for it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him? ####<iemocap>sadness
yeah. ####<iemocap>sadness
Is he an actor too, or-? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes of course, of course. ####<iemocap>sadness
Was he very close to his family? ####<iemocap>neutral
yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid. ####<iemocap>sadness
Is there a funeral planned? or- ####<iemocap>neutral
Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will. ####<iemocap>neutral
No problem. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real. ####<iemocap>sadness
yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess. ####<iemocap>neutral
That's the best way to put it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely. ####<iemocap>neutral
Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be. ####<iemocap>neutral
So guess what. ####<iemocap>excited
I got into college. ####<iemocap>excited
U.S.C.. ####<iemocap>excited
yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
No. ####<iemocap>excited
I'll stay in town. ####<iemocap>excited
Uh- I don't know. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, I don't want to, I don't want to live with my mom. ####<iemocap>neutral
Whoa.  What an idea.  Where would you want to live? ####<iemocap>excited
Whoa, this is going to be so much fun. ####<iemocap>excited
Thank you. I know, I'm really, really, really excited. ####<iemocap>excited
I know they have a really, really great program for what I want to do. ####<iemocap>excited
Can we for real live together? ####<iemocap>excited
awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
So should we get a place near campus? or- ####<iemocap>excited
okay. ####<iemocap>excited
It's going to be ridiculous.  It's going to be so cool. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean. ####<iemocap>excited
I- I hear the same. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't know how I feel about that, but- ####<iemocap>excited
oh yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
oh yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure. ####<iemocap>excited
Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] by yourself. ####<iemocap>excited
you'd be that kid ####<iemocap>excited
living near campus, and not going to school. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
We should go apartment shop-er-hunting. ####<iemocap>excited
Let's go tomorrow. ####<iemocap>excited
yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Woo- ####<iemocap>excited
exciting. ####<iemocap>excited
what ####<iemocap>excited
Shut up.  What'd you get, where'd you get accepted to? please ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, sweet. ####<iemocap>excited
So you're not going to leave me. ####<iemocap>excited
oh, good good good good good good. ####<iemocap>excited
Are you going to live on campus?  Where are you going to live? ####<iemocap>excited
Uh! stay over here.  Like travel to school. because you are so close to me ####<iemocap>excited
Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right,  right.  Maybe we should get a place together. ####<iemocap>joy
That'll be awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't know.  Well.  I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so. ####<iemocap>excited
But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you. ####<iemocap>excited
it is going to be so much fun. Yes. ####<iemocap>excited
Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C.. ####<iemocap>excited
You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together. ####<iemocap>excited
Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want. ####<iemocap>excited
That'll be great. That'll be great. ####<iemocap>excited
We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there? ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, me either. ####<iemocap>excited
[garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out.  Right?  [garbage] it is going to be so much fun. ####<iemocap>excited
You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though. ####<iemocap>excited
Woo- I I do. ####<iemocap>excited
I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it.  I know you are. I can tell. I know you. ####<iemocap>excited
You're a wild and crazy woman. ####<iemocap>excited
Uh huh, it will be awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad. ####<iemocap>excited
Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, it's going to be so much fun. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, congratulations. and to me too, because now I get to-have- ####<iemocap>excited
That's a good idea. ####<iemocap>excited
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow- ####<iemocap>excited
Good.  We'll have to have one soon, you're going to have to go to school in a couple of months. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh God, it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places. [garbage] ####<iemocap>excited
Hi, sir.  How can I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time. ####<iemocap>neutral
I kwon, it is ridiculous ####<iemocap>neutral
yeah, I understand. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh- when's when's- ####<iemocap>neutral
Sir- ####<iemocap>frustrated
If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill? ####<iemocap>neutral
In the mail? ####<iemocap>neutral
So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can... ####<iemocap>neutral
if I call it up on the screen. ####<iemocap>neutral
So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid. ####<iemocap>neutral
You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct? ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah so- That --that did go through. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me. ####<iemocap>neutral
yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
No problem. ####<iemocap>neutral
ahh one eight hundred three two three ####<iemocap>neutral
six four nine four ####<iemocap>neutral
You're welcome ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience. ####<iemocap>neutral
Have a good day. ####<iemocap>neutral
bye bye ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, thank God.  Do you know how long I've been on the phone for half an hour trying to talk to a freaking human being. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All I want to do is put my, pay for my freaking credit card, and there's something wrong in my bill, Like I swear, it says I didn't paid last month, but I know I paid last month. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I put- I've been typing my number in millions of times, it won't listen to me, it's not working, and I can't get a single human being, and finally- ####<iemocap>frustrated
This is ridiculous.  I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody.  They have never, ever work for me. ####<iemocap>angry
Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, okay ,well First off, fine, fine, fine.  Let's see, first off, um- yeah my bill's wrong. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee. ####<iemocap>angry
I got it in the mail. ####<iemocap>frustrated
yeah ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site- ####<iemocap>frustrated
like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, great, go ahead. ####<iemocap>neutral
It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, No, No, I am grateful. ####<iemocap>neutral
Did they take- ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes, yes, exactly. ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you taking the late fee off of my account then? ####<iemocap>neutral
Because I paid it on time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Really? ####<iemocap>neutral
That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously. ####<iemocap>joy
thank you, what's the number? ####<iemocap>joy
three two three ####<iemocap>neutral
six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much. ####<iemocap>joy
It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely ####<iemocap>joy
You too, thank you so much, have a wonderful day. ####<iemocap>joy
What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it. ####<iemocap>sadness
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
He cried hard. ####<iemocap>sadness
He is thinking about him again. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night. ####<iemocap>sadness
What's the meaning of that? ####<iemocap>sadness
To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well I got an idea.  But what's the story? ####<iemocap>neutral
I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Have you asked Annie yet to marry you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father? ####<iemocap>neutral
The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have ####<iemocap>neutral
Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>sadness
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>angry
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that! ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you! ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
He saw it. ####<iemocap>sadness
He was out here when it broke. ####<iemocap>sadness
Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone. ####<iemocap>sadness
I could hear him right through the floor of my room. ####<iemocap>sadness
I guess, he is. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad. ####<iemocap>sadness
Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him? ####<iemocap>sadness
No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We have to say it to him! ####<iemocap>frustrated
For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane! ####<iemocap>angry
Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, All right mom.  Listen! ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know why I asked Annie here, don't you? ####<iemocap>sadness
You know. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
You know that's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that! ####<iemocap>angry
So what, I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, then, Mom. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York? ####<iemocap>frustrated
The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me? ####<iemocap>angry
She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden? ####<iemocap>neutral
What's going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>frustrated
She's not his girl.  She knows she's not. ####<iemocap>angry
She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want you to pretend like he's coming back! ####<iemocap>angry
Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself. ####<iemocap>angry
Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces? ####<iemocap>angry
Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
You've got to believe. You've got to-- ####<iemocap>sadness
I can't help it! ####<iemocap>angry
Why does that bother you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again. ####<iemocap>neutral
What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you. ####<iemocap>neutral
How do you know he is even thinking about it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, so what. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now, listen, Kate, just- ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know why she's waited? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do? What do you want-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
But, Kate... ####<iemocap>frustrated
[LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself! ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right, all right.  Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking! ####<iemocap>angry
What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate? ####<iemocap>angry
You're the only one I know who loves his parents. ####<iemocap>joy
No, it's good. ####<iemocap>joy
It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet. ####<iemocap>joy
No.  But I'm not going to stay. ####<iemocap>joy
Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, from her point of view why else would I come? ####<iemocap>neutral
I guess this is why I came. ####<iemocap>joy
I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you! ####<iemocap>joy
Not like that, you're not. ####<iemocap>joy
Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter? ####<iemocap>joy
It wouldn't work like this. ####<iemocap>sadness
yeah sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
how many? ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh gee. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you still feel like that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that. ####<iemocap>sadness
What would I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
I know.  It's going out of style isn't it? ####<iemocap>joy
Why? ####<iemocap>neutral
What? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set. ####<iemocap>joy
How did you know? ####<iemocap>neutral
Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you! ####<iemocap>joy
I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know. ####<iemocap>excited
You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me. ####<iemocap>sadness
It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I- ####<iemocap>sadness
Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah.  I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men- ####<iemocap>sadness
for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and- ####<iemocap>sadness
but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me? ####<iemocap>sadness
And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them. ####<iemocap>sadness
And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here. ####<iemocap>sadness
It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and ####<iemocap>sadness
It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that! ####<iemocap>sadness
I I want you now, Annie. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune! ####<iemocap>joy
Fine. ####<iemocap>neutral
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not your flashlight. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel? ####<iemocap>frustrated
yes. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's after eleven, let's go home. ####<iemocap>neutral
There is no point in coming out here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So let's go. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Not particularly. ####<iemocap>neutral
I just don't. ####<iemocap>neutral
Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I am just not. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yes. ####<iemocap>neutral
Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better-- ####<iemocap>excited
actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight. ####<iemocap>excited
The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Whose is it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, Sure. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it. ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around ####<iemocap>excited
you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>excited
Right. ####<iemocap>excited
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity. ####<iemocap>excited
Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that. ####<iemocap>excited
This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah ####<iemocap>excited
Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that. ####<iemocap>excited
There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested. ####<iemocap>excited
For real? ####<iemocap>neutral
We weren't in a good spot. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second. ####<iemocap>excited
Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that. ####<iemocap>excited
It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming. ####<iemocap>excited
They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, So what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
I am sorry.  It's just fish to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Twice is every time we tried, that's ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For heaven's sake, this is not about fish. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant. ####<iemocap>sadness
We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be. ####<iemocap>joy
Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No no. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out. ####<iemocap>frustrated
This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything. ####<iemocap>sadness
Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting. ####<iemocap>sadness
But this isn't anything like I thought it would be. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you. ####<iemocap>sadness
Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself. ####<iemocap>sadness
Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person. ####<iemocap>joy
Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon. ####<iemocap>joy
No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, so?  What do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
What I was just saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>neutral
I am not the only one, look at all these people. ####<iemocap>neutral
Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period? ####<iemocap>neutral
What's bugging you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why not? ####<iemocap>frustrated
We miss them twice, it's not ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well We will see them this year. ####<iemocap>neutral
I thought you wanted to see it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Wait a minute, I got it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance? ####<iemocap>excited
You want me to go get some champagne? ####<iemocap>excited
Take off our shoes? ####<iemocap>excited
You want to get married again? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What? What You want a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
What.  Welcome to the human race. ####<iemocap>angry
No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I know me either. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you are with somebody else too? ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, look what we have got here. ####<iemocap>joy
Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, it sent shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Behave exquisitely. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey. ####<iemocap>excited
The whole business is really rather ridiculous. ####<iemocap>neutral
Meaning exactly that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Who's they? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what if-what happens when our love- ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then? ####<iemocap>neutral
Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully. ####<iemocap>excited
And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous ####<iemocap>joy
You knew there was nothing. ####<iemocap>neutral
Good God. ####<iemocap>excited
I wonder. ####<iemocap>excited
Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us? ####<iemocap>neutral
With the most perfect poise. ####<iemocap>excited
What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean? ####<iemocap>excited
All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light. ####<iemocap>excited
Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER]. ####<iemocap>excited
Who knows? ####<iemocap>excited
No, that fire will fade along with our passion. ####<iemocap>excited
It all depends on how well we played. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes, yes, with all his might. ####<iemocap>excited
No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors. ####<iemocap>excited
no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and -- ####<iemocap>excited
enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment. ####<iemocap>excited
Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice? ####<iemocap>excited
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed. ####<iemocap>excited
Horrible thing, I hate it. ####<iemocap>excited
How long did that row last? ####<iemocap>excited
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, I didn't hit you very hard. ####<iemocap>neutral
[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, we were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden. ####<iemocap>excited
You knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Only a trivial little broach. ####<iemocap>neutral
You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. ####<iemocap>neutral
maybe just a little, but-- ####<iemocap>neutral
And what of it? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's becoming a habit with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Just making myself fascinating for you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you. ####<iemocap>angry
adder don't snap, they sting. ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I did quite a bit. ####<iemocap>neutral
Mind your own business. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>angry
Ugh. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why? ####<iemocap>angry
There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio. ####<iemocap>angry
They're away in Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it on again. ####<iemocap>angry
Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, do try to control yourself darling. ####<iemocap>angry
You really do need to develop uh a clearer head. ####<iemocap>angry
I- I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous. ####<iemocap>angry
Beast; brute; cad; whore ####<iemocap>angry
You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he? ####<iemocap>angry
You let him kiss you.  You said you did. ####<iemocap>angry
What of it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, that's a nice point of view I must say. ####<iemocap>angry
So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy? ####<iemocap>neutral
I'll have a little I think. ####<iemocap>neutral
You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment. ####<iemocap>angry
Really, Amanda. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, that reply has broken my heart. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, yes it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
They snap. ####<iemocap>angry
[BREATHING] ####<iemocap>frustrated
Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce? ####<iemocap>angry
I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then. ####<iemocap>angry
You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You better turn that off I think. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Turn it off.  It is driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off. ####<iemocap>angry
Amanda-- Listen- Listen- ####<iemocap>angry
Very music- amusing indeed. ####<iemocap>angry
You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again. ####<iemocap>angry
Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again. ####<iemocap>angry
Can I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V.. ####<iemocap>neutral
Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything- ####<iemocap>neutral
No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California -- ####<iemocap>neutral
Sir, don't get an attitude with me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did. ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Sir, you- I mean ####<iemocap>frustrated
You can waist as much as you want ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now. ####<iemocap>neutral
I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sir, please don't waste my time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They're different forms, we process them all different- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I -- there's no way I'd make an exception. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form. ####<iemocap>frustrated
They're processed differently. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out. ####<iemocap>angry
But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now. ####<iemocap>angry
What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude. ####<iemocap>angry
Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Might as well get started now? but Just take this one. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me. ####<iemocap>angry
Shh...I know you've got the power to do that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D. ####<iemocap>frustrated
