I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying -- ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you getting defensive? ####<iemocap>neutral

Uh, God.  I don't know what to do anymore.  Like I said -- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't know.  There's nothing for me out there.  I can't get a job.  I haven't gotten a job in a year, three years.  What is it, three years now; right? That I haven't been able to have a job. ####<iemocap>frustrated

I mean, You can tell me what.  Why is no one hiring me?  Is it me?  Be honest.  You can tell me. you know I can take it.  I can take it, you just tell me. Why? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, but I'm -- okay, well how about personality wise?  I mean, people who know me won't hire me.  Why? ####<iemocap>frustrated
An abrasive vibe? ####<iemocap>angry
Let me know that's -- that's fine.  You think I have an abrasive vibe, whatever.  You're entitled to your opinion, of course.  Maybe that's why I don't have a job. ####<iemocap>angry

I want to make some money.  I need to make some money.  I've got to pay some bills, I owe people money.  I owe lots of people money.  I need to make some money. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you have any idea how I can make money?  I mean, what can I do to make some quick money, something?  Anything, that's relatively within the you know law. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Right, probably not selling pot. I don't want to go to jail. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because that would just really be a topper for me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Thank you.  Ha ha. ####<iemocap>frustrated
See what I mean?  You can't even think of anything. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I can juggle. ####<iemocap>frustrated

Yes!  Nobody wants a juggler.  I am not going to -- I'm not going to dress up like a clown. I'm not going to dress up like a freaking clown. No. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, it's demeaning.  I am not a clown.  I have talent.  Clowns don't have talent. ####<iemocap>frustrated

No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra. ####<iemocap>neutral
well, it's something that worth ####<iemocap>neutral
yeah, I don't know. ####<iemocap>neutral
Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane. ####<iemocap>neutral
Um, well, there's not much I can do.  I can, you can file this report and we'll call you when it comes in. ####<iemocap>neutral

Uh- Like, an hour and a half ago.  I talked to somebody who was standing out there and they said wait.  Sometimes like random butt- pieces come out late. ####<iemocap>neutral
And so I waited there, but nothing came. ####<iemocap>neutral
I was coming from um the Midwest, like Iowa. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, I know I was in the country.  I mean, it's not that complicated. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I would hope so. ####<iemocap>neutral
People lose -- ####<iemocap>neutral
forever? ####<iemocap>neutral
You know, this is actually, I mean it's -- it's a really important piece of luggage. ####<iemocap>neutral
I mean, it's not big or anything like that.  I mean, it's not worth a lot of money or anything. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, no one even told me about that.  Like, why would I think to buy insurance?  I was- It's like a three hour flight. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How can you lose my luggage like from like, in -- ####<iemocap>frustrated
I should hope so.  You know, I need that today. ####<iemocap>frustrated

I mean, one second you think, you know, you're just having a conversation and then -- ####<iemocap>sadness
you know, sometimes you think you want to make that phone call, or you think you want to tell somebody something, or something like that.  Do you know what I mean?  Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with.  You know, like, that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time. ####<iemocap>sadness
And now I don't have that person anymore, you know.  And it's -- -- it's just, you. ####<iemocap>sadness

I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean.  And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway. ####<iemocap>excited
They don't live here.  They don't know, right? ####<iemocap>excited
yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Exactly.  You make it what you make it. You know? Right? And I'm gonna make it so freaking awesome. ####<iemocap>excited
yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, I don't know.  I've got to go look for a place. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, yeah.  I- I don't- I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions? ####<iemocap>excited
You know the area better than I do. ####<iemocap>excited
Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right? ####<iemocap>excited
I don't care. I don't care. ####<iemocap>excited
yeah? ####<iemocap>excited
That would be perfect. ####<iemocap>excited
Really? ####<iemocap>excited
Really? ####<iemocap>excited
Cheap is exactly what I need- Because I have no money at all. ####<iemocap>excited
But, uh-- ####<iemocap>excited
Loans, scholarships, I've got a lot of scholarships-- Yeah, yeah. I'm- I'm half Native American so I get all those scholarships, too. yeah. ####<iemocap>excited
So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so. ####<iemocap>excited
And yeah, well, I mean, basically I just applied for any and every possible scholarship and grant that could come by, so I can go. ####<iemocap>joy
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's gonna work out.  I'm gonna be able to pay for it, I'm gonna go, I mean, I'll have a little debt in the end.  But I don't care. ####<iemocap>excited
It's just you know a dream come true.  How could you not be excited about a dream come true? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh I know, I know. ####<iemocap>excited
But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean?  It's the kind of busy you've got to love, right? ####<iemocap>excited
Because you're doing something you love.  That's the kind of busy you want.  I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life.  Be that kind of busy. ####<iemocap>excited
I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited. ####<iemocap>excited
We'll have fun. ####<iemocap>joy
Great.  Okay. ####<iemocap>excited
Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah.  That my service just goes out. ####<iemocap>frustrated
yeah. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And- ####<iemocap>frustrated
Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times. ####<iemocap>neutral
Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hmm. Mmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
yeah. ####<iemocap>neutral
It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but -- ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh huh. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, I see that. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh huh, Okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros. ####<iemocap>neutral
Wow.  That would be amazing.  Really? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now. ####<iemocap>joy
It's so frustrating. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome. ####<iemocap>joy
Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind. ####<iemocap>joy
No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now. ####<iemocap>joy
Okay.  Thanks. ####<iemocap>joy
D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you? ####<iemocap>neutral
This happens every two weeks? ####<iemocap>neutral
You've lost your connection. ####<iemocap>neutral
okay. ####<iemocap>neutral
Hmm.  Mmm. ####<iemocap>neutral
Has somebody tried to pin your site? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it -- ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on. ####<iemocap>neutral
Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list. ####<iemocap>neutral
And hit enter. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay?  Can you tell me what that says? ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter. ####<iemocap>neutral
Okay?  Does it list your IP address there? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's -- ####<iemocap>neutral
Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore. ####<iemocap>neutral
I completely understand. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore. ####<iemocap>neutral
Absolutely.  It's a new service we are offering. ####<iemocap>neutral
Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay? ####<iemocap>neutral
Great.  Well, that makes me very happy.  That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme.  Is there anything else I can help you with? ####<iemocap>joy
All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime. ####<iemocap>neutral
All right.  Bye, bye. ####<iemocap>joy
What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it. ####<iemocap>sadness
When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it? ####<iemocap>sadness
Did you talk to him? ####<iemocap>sadness
He cried hard? ####<iemocap>sadness
What do you want to do, argue with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>angry
I'm just saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you? ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that ####<iemocap>neutral
Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you. ####<iemocap>angry
Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me? ####<iemocap>angry
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yeah, I can see that. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone. ####<iemocap>sadness
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now? ####<iemocap>angry
We have to say it to him. ####<iemocap>frustrated
For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane! ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you? ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, so it isn't just my business? ####<iemocap>angry
You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God. ####<iemocap>angry
Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things. ####<iemocap>angry
She is not Larry's girl! ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
To hell with that! ####<iemocap>angry
So what?  I'm not fast with women. ####<iemocap>angry
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy. ####<iemocap>angry
But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out. ####<iemocap>angry
I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York. ####<iemocap>angry
I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes.  On this, I would. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, you help me stay here. ####<iemocap>angry
I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it. ####<iemocap>sadness
What do you mean?  I was the first one up, he was still in bed. ####<iemocap>neutral
The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you-- ####<iemocap>frustrated
What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Have you asked Annie yet? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does. ####<iemocap>neutral
The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years. ####<iemocap>neutral
No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't. ####<iemocap>sadness
What the hell is this? ####<iemocap>neutral
Are you crazy? ####<iemocap>angry
Must you be inspired? ####<iemocap>angry
You don't want to think like that. ####<iemocap>angry
All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't understand you, do I? ####<iemocap>frustrated
He was out here when it broke. ####<iemocap>sadness
About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen. ####<iemocap>sadness
No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time? ####<iemocap>frustrated
For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane! ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  All right, just listen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You know it's not just my business. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things. ####<iemocap>angry
She's not Larry's girl. ####<iemocap>angry
I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time. ####<iemocap>frustrated
what to hell with that! ####<iemocap>angry
I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
So what, I'm not fast with women? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Because it is. ####<iemocap>frustrated
[garbage] I don't know.  It's just, ####<iemocap>frustrated
she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram? ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right then, mom. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy. ####<iemocap>angry
But if that can't happen then I'll just get out. ####<iemocap>angry
I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York. ####<iemocap>angry
The business?  The business doesn't inspire me. ####<iemocap>angry
Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids. ####<iemocap>angry
I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, I am thinking like that. ####<iemocap>angry
No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy. ####<iemocap>angry
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see. ####<iemocap>neutral
He's got that about it. ####<iemocap>neutral
What's going on here, Joe? ####<iemocap>angry
I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me! ####<iemocap>frustrated
Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You above all have got to believe. ####<iemocap>angry
I can't help it. ####<iemocap>angry
Why does that bother you? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again. ####<iemocap>neutral
What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Why do you think he's even thinking that? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, so what? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now listen. ####<iemocap>frustrated
How do you know why she's waited? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
But Kate? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Calm yourself. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  All right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking. ####<iemocap>angry
What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you? ####<iemocap>angry
You're the only one I know who loves his parents. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave. ####<iemocap>neutral
I figured they would, your mother at least. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here? ####<iemocap>neutral
Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time. ####<iemocap>joy
I almost got married two years ago. ####<iemocap>sadness
Everyday since. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous. ####<iemocap>excited
Not like that you're not. ####<iemocap>excited
Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter? ####<iemocap>sadness
Even in your letters there was something ashamed. ####<iemocap>sadness
You have to tell me. ####<iemocap>sadness
It wouldn't work like this. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, sure. ####<iemocap>neutral
How many? ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you still feel like that? ####<iemocap>sadness
Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included. ####<iemocap>sadness
[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune? ####<iemocap>joy
So, you're not sorry I came? ####<iemocap>excited
Why? ####<iemocap>neutral
Well- ####<iemocap>neutral
You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything. ####<iemocap>excited
Why didn't you? ####<iemocap>neutral
You felt something that far back? ####<iemocap>joy
oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy. ####<iemocap>excited
I kissed you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you. ####<iemocap>sadness
No, nothing like that. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me. ####<iemocap>sadness
I don't I don't know where to start. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's so mixed up with so many other things. ####<iemocap>sadness
I lost them. ####<iemocap>sadness
Just about all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men. ####<iemocap>sadness
I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other. ####<iemocap>sadness
I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down. ####<iemocap>sadness
It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there. ####<iemocap>sadness
I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all. ####<iemocap>sadness
It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean, ####<iemocap>frustrated
you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it. ####<iemocap>frustrated
And I guess that included you. ####<iemocap>sadness
I want you now, Annie. ####<iemocap>sadness
Oh, Annie, ####<iemocap>excited
Annie I am going to make you a fortune. ####<iemocap>joy
Fine. ####<iemocap>sadness
What flashlight? ####<iemocap>neutral
Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Augie. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm just not. ####<iemocap>sadness
Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We didn't see them the first time either. ####<iemocap>frustrated
What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing? ####<iemocap>excited
What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think? ####<iemocap>excited
This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight. ####<iemocap>excited
The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally. ####<iemocap>excited
How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember? ####<iemocap>excited
Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now. ####<iemocap>excited
I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something ####<iemocap>excited
Do you want my jacket? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh ####<iemocap>frustrated
Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity. ####<iemocap>excited
I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know, ####<iemocap>excited
and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that. ####<iemocap>excited
I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy. ####<iemocap>excited
Yeah, they do. ####<iemocap>frustrated
All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested. ####<iemocap>excited
For real? ####<iemocap>frustrated
I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second; ####<iemocap>excited
somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And- ####<iemocap>excited
And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name, ####<iemocap>excited
they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up. ####<iemocap>excited
Well, so what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
About what? ####<iemocap>neutral
It's ridiculous. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me. ####<iemocap>frustrated
God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting. ####<iemocap>angry
I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We We don't ever.  Have we ever? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever ####<iemocap>angry
No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up. ####<iemocap>angry
You don't understand anything I am saying. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is. ####<iemocap>sadness
Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them. ####<iemocap>sadness
And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle. ####<iemocap>sadness
I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
No. ####<iemocap>sadness
I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to. ####<iemocap>sadness
But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be. ####<iemocap>sadness
This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense? ####<iemocap>sadness
I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but. ####<iemocap>sadness
But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else. ####<iemocap>sadness
I didn't say that. ####<iemocap>sadness
For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself. ####<iemocap>sadness
Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon. ####<iemocap>joy
No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, so, what do you think? ####<iemocap>excited
What I was just saying. ####<iemocap>excited
It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact. ####<iemocap>frustrated
uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period? ####<iemocap>neutral
What's bugging you then? ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home. ####<iemocap>frustrated
We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No, of course not. ####<iemocap>frustrated
I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so -- ####<iemocap>frustrated
you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right? ####<iemocap>neutral
What, you want me to blow in your ear? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A vacation? ####<iemocap>frustrated
A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish? ####<iemocap>angry
Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us! ####<iemocap>angry
Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This. ####<iemocap>angry
Right. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Now, I know.  Me either ####<iemocap>sadness
I'm trying the best I can. ####<iemocap>sadness
Maybe if you're with somebody else, too? ####<iemocap>sadness
No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy. ####<iemocap>sadness
Really? ####<iemocap>neutral
Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't. ####<iemocap>joy
I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here. ####<iemocap>joy
Oh, well look what we've got here. ####<iemocap>joy
Well, it isn't champagne. ####<iemocap>joy
Or not. ####<iemocap>joy
Do you think it's them? ####<iemocap>neutral
what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up. ####<iemocap>excited
What do we do? ####<iemocap>excited
Now and always, my sweet. ####<iemocap>excited
It was bound to happen sooner or later. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, it sent shivers up my spine. ####<iemocap>excited
Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious. ####<iemocap>neutral
Who's they? ####<iemocap>neutral
If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, will we always bicker and fight? ####<iemocap>neutral
What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then? ####<iemocap>neutral
Elliott, worms don't pop. ####<iemocap>neutral
I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom. ####<iemocap>excited
You knew there was nothing in that. ####<iemocap>neutral
I wonder. ####<iemocap>excited
Must be them then? ####<iemocap>neutral
We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens? ####<iemocap>neutral
I don't care then. ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us. ####<iemocap>excited
With the worst- with the most perfect poise? ####<iemocap>excited
Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel-- ####<iemocap>excited
things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they? ####<iemocap>excited
Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling. ####<iemocap>excited
Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love. ####<iemocap>excited
Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean? ####<iemocap>excited
You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want. ####<iemocap>excited
All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths. ####<iemocap>excited
uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light. ####<iemocap>excited
Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right. ####<iemocap>excited
No.  That fire will fade along with our passion. ####<iemocap>excited
Yes, yes, with all his might. ####<iemocap>excited
No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors. ####<iemocap>excited
So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children. ####<iemocap>excited
[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets. ####<iemocap>excited
I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best. ####<iemocap>excited
Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice? ####<iemocap>excited
The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed. ####<iemocap>excited
Horrible thing.  I hated it. ####<iemocap>excited
How long did that roue last? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown? ####<iemocap>excited
[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it? ####<iemocap>excited
Oh, I didn't hit you very hard. ####<iemocap>excited
I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER] ####<iemocap>excited
We were very much younger then. ####<iemocap>excited
Only a trivial little broach. ####<iemocap>neutral
Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often. ####<iemocap>neutral
[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well, what of it. ####<iemocap>neutral
Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me. ####<iemocap>neutral
I'm getting very bored with this conversation. ####<iemocap>frustrated
No thanks. ####<iemocap>neutral
It's becoming a habit with you. ####<iemocap>neutral
Don't be stupid. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Just making myself fascinating for you. ####<iemocap>neutral
No, it isn't. ####<iemocap>angry
No, it it is not, be quiet. ####<iemocap>angry
They sting. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Yes, I did quite a lot. ####<iemocap>neutral
You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk. ####<iemocap>frustrated
You always had a weak head. ####<iemocap>neutral
Not- Would you shut up. ####<iemocap>angry
You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic. ####<iemocap>angry
You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself. ####<iemocap>angry
Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you. ####<iemocap>angry
You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully. ####<iemocap>angry
Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible. ####<iemocap>angry
This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end. ####<iemocap>angry
Yes, I am. Let go with me ####<iemocap>angry
You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never! ####<iemocap>angry
Beast ####<iemocap>angry
Brute ####<iemocap>angry
pig ####<iemocap>angry
You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he? ####<iemocap>frustrated
He let him kiss you.  You said you did. ####<iemocap>frustrated
Well, that's a nice point of view I must say. ####<iemocap>angry
Me, too, bored stiff. ####<iemocap>angry
Do you want some brandy? ####<iemocap>neutral
I think I'll have a little. ####<iemocap>neutral
Amanda, really. ####<iemocap>angry
Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling? ####<iemocap>frustrated
Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart. ####<iemocap>frustrated
It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. ####<iemocap>angry
Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap! ####<iemocap>frustrated
They snap. ####<iemocap>angry
So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce? ####<iemocap>neutral
You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh? ####<iemocap>angry
I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway. ####<iemocap>angry
I am not the slightest bit drunk. ####<iemocap>angry
I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine? ####<iemocap>angry
You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots. ####<iemocap>angry
You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will. ####<iemocap>angry
You better turn that off, I think. ####<iemocap>angry
Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs. ####<iemocap>angry
Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose. ####<iemocap>angry
This is no time of the year for Tunis. ####<iemocap>angry
I do I shall do no such thing. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off.  It's driving me mad. ####<iemocap>angry
Turn it off! ####<iemocap>angry
Very amusing indeed. ####<iemocap>angry
Ja! Very funny. ####<iemocap>angry
You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again. ####<iemocap>angry
Oh, you're not going like this. ####<iemocap>angry
[GARBAGE] No, you're not. ####<iemocap>angry
oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. ####<iemocap>angry
You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. ####<iemocap>angry
